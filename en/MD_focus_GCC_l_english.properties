GCC_socio_economic_affairs코0=Socio-Economic Affairs
GCC_socio_economic_affairs_desc코0=The economy and society of [ROOT.GetNameDef] yield interesting challenges. Many argue that our current dependence on oil is unsustainable and outsiders have criticized our policies towards foreign migrants. Moreover, voices from both within and without are clamoring for improvements in the rights of women.
GCC_the_rentier_state코0=The Rentier State
GCC_the_rentier_state_desc코0=The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy is commonly characterized as that of a rentier state. This is due to how our income is derived from external oil "rents". This income is then distributed to our subjects in the form of subsidies and welfare, allowing our country to function without a tax system or representative government. However, it is a well-known fact that one day the oil that this system depends upon will run out.
GCC_expand_oil_extraction코0=Expand Oil Extraction
GCC_expand_oil_extraction_desc코0=While the need to diversify our economy is clear, that does not mean that we need to put an immediate stop to our oil extraction activities.
GCC_joint_ventures코0=Joint Ventures
GCC_joint_ventures_desc코0=While [fossil_fuel_industry_name] is perfectly capable of carrying out its oil extraction activities on its own, it could still benefit from the resources and technological knowhow of other oil firms.
GCC_total_sa코0=Total S.A.
GCC_total_sa_desc코0=Total is a French oil and gas company and one of the seven "Supermajor" oil companies.
GCC_royal_dutch_shell코0=Royal Dutch Shell
GCC_royal_dutch_shell_desc코0=Shell is an Ango-Dutch firm and the third-largest company in the world. Its resources and expertise accumulated over more than a century could be a great asset for [fossil_fuel_industry_name].
GCC_lukoil코0=Lukoil
GCC_lukoil_desc코0=The Russian energy giant Lukoil may not have the long history of some of its European competitors, but it has nonetheless grown rapidly to become one of the world's largest oil producers.
GCC_sinopec코0=Sinopec
GCC_sinopec_desc코0=The China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec is the world's largest oil refining, gas and petrochemical conglomerate and can therefore draw upon immense financial resources.
GCC_stock_market_listing코0=Stock Market Listing
GCC_stock_market_listing_desc코0=An initial public offering (IPO) of [fossil_fuel_industry_name] will in many ways act as a litmus test of our country's stability. If domestic and international investors have confidence in our country the IPO will be a success, but it may also fail to raise substantial sums of money. The amount of money raised by our IPO will determine how much we can contribute to our sovereign wealth fund.
GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund코0=Sovereign Wealth Fund
GCC_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc코0=The windfall from the IPO can bolster our sovereign wealth fund, improving our ability to make investments abroad as well as to finance public services and infrastructure projects at home.
GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry코0=Secure the Fossil Fuel Industry
GCC_secure_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc코0=State control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name] has served us well in the past and shall continue to do so. Even without direct ownership over the company, our government can keep [fossil_fuel_industry_name] on a tight leash and prevent it from becoming too autonomous.
GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry코0=Untether the Fossil Fuel Industry
GCC_untether_the_fossil_fuel_industry_desc코0=For decades we have maintained tight control over [fossil_fuel_industry_name], but with the IPO the time has come to relinquish our iron grip. Such a move will undoubtedly anger those who currently benefit from state control and will allow an independent power base to form in the company's leadership. However relinquishing control will allow the company to more effeciently carry out its activities.
GCC_innovative_techniques코0=Innovative Techniques
GCC_innovative_techniques_desc코0=The 21st century brings new challenges and new opportunities. We must use these opportunities to develop new and intelligent ways to overcome the challenges involved in oil extraction.
GCC_deepen_the_safety_net코0=Deepen the Safety Net
GCC_deepen_the_safety_net_desc코0=Our system of rule relies on the distribution of wealth to our citizens through public services. We can put our oil revenues towards an expansion of this system of patronage. This will shore up support for our government.
GCC_subsidize_economic_activity코0=Subsidize Economic Activity
GCC_subsidize_economic_activity_desc코0=Subsidies for the business activities of our merchant class is another major avenue of patronage provision which our authority depends on. Not only will increasing subsidies with our oil revenues shore up the merchant class's support for our government, but it will also help stimulate the [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy.
GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks코0=Reinforce Patronage Networks
GCC_reinforce_patronage_networks_desc코0=While our subjects and the merchant class are important sources of support for our government, there are other political forces whose loyalty is even more crucial to our government's survival. We should reinforce the patronage networks that guarantee the loyalty of these political actors.
GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry코0=Invest in the Metal Industry
GCC_invest_in_the_metal_industry_desc코0=While our country is most known for the extraction and export of fossil fuels, God has also gifted our country with light metals. While focusing on the extraction of these raw materials will do little to diversify our economy, it will provide useful short-term benefits.
GCC_diversify_the_economy코0=Diversify the Economy
GCC_diversify_the_economy_desc코0=In order to reduce our reliance on oil we should invest in other sectors of the economy particular the secondary and tertiary sectors relating to manufacturing and services. This will be no easy task and will inevitably encounter opposition from those who benefit from the status quo.
GCC_shrink_the_safety_net코0=Shrink the Safety Net
GCC_shrink_the_safety_net_desc코0=Our current provision of social services is important to our government's legitimacy but is bloated and unsustainable. We must make necessary cuts in order to further the diversification of our economy.
GCC_private_sector_job_creation코0=Private Sector Job Creation
GCC_private_sector_job_creation_desc코0=Our government has historically employed the majority of citizens in the public sector. While this has ensured stable employment for the people of [ROOT.GetNameDef], it is not a state of affairs that is conducive to a dynamic and diversified economy. We should open up space within the private sector for former public sector employees but this will naturally involve a shrinking of the public sector.
GCC_construction_boom코0=Construction Boom
GCC_construction_boom_desc코0=Investing in construction is essential to achieving a diversified economy.
GCC_support_the_aviation_sector코0=Support the Aviation Sector
GCC_support_the_aviation_sector_desc코0=Airlines from Etihad to Qatar Airways have bolstered the international image of their home countries and are unique enterprises in otherwise oil-dominated economies. We should support our domestic aviation industry to capitalize on this reputation and increase our progress towards diversification.
GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry코0=Support the Entertainment Industry
GCC_support_the_entertainment_industry_desc코0=Film and music are areas in which our country is decidedly lacking. Supporting these sectors of the economy will not only develop useful economic opportunities but will also increase our government's support among the wider population. However, this policy's contradiction with fundamentalist Islamic values may make us enemies in some quarters.
GCC_support_manufacturing코0=Support Manufacturing
GCC_support_manufacturing_desc코0=Because of our country's vast natural resources, [ROOT.GetNameDef] has never fully industrialized. In addition to developing the service sector, we should also support our budding manufacturing industry.
GCC_the_dubai_model코0=The Dubai Model
GCC_the_dubai_model_desc코0=Dubai has developed a unique economic model by the standards of the Gulf, one that has successfully reduced the Emirate of Dubai's reliance on oil. However, this model of encouraging foreign investment and tourism has come at a cost, with many residents of Dubai feeling disenchanted with Westernization and uneven economic growth.
GCC_reduce_vice_prevention코0=Reduce Vice Prevention
GCC_reduce_vice_prevention_desc코0=In order to attract foreigners to our country we must first relax some of our more austere laws, particularly those regarding the prohibition of alcohol and restrictions on clothing. However, these actions will not be without consequences.
GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses코0=Court Tourism and Foreign Businesses
GCC_court_tourism_and_foreign_businesses_desc코0=Now that we have sufficiently relaxed our social laws, we have paved the way for foreign investment to support our domestic infrastructure and for the tourism sector to act as an alternative to oil.
GCC_end_the_rentier_state코0=End the Rentier State
GCC_end_the_rentier_state_desc코0=The rentier state depends upon a constant stream of oil revenue. Given that this is no longer possible, it is high time that we put an end to the rentier state and find alternative sources of legitimacy.
GCC_end_oil_dependency코0=End Oil Dependency
GCC_end_oil_dependency_desc코0=Our diversification efforts have finally borne fruit. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] economy no longer has to depend solely on the production and export of fossil fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future.
GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates코0=Empower Industrial Conglomerates
GCC_empower_industrial_conglomerates_desc코0=Our support for manufacturing has allowed industrial conglomerates to begin accumulating capital and influence. Supporting this new economic force will help consolidate our burgeoning secondary sector but will create a new power base that could seek to influence government policy.
GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants코0=Commit to Domestic Merchants
GCC_commit_to_domestic_merchants_desc코0=The merchant class has historically been key to the economy of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and as such has wielded significant influence in [ROOT.GetAdjective] affairs. We should remain committed to supporting these merchants in order to preserve the existing internal balance of power.
GCC_cater_to_investors코0=Cater to Investors
GCC_cater_to_investors_desc코0=The future lies not in manufacturing or in traditional forms of commerce but in modern finance. As such we should develop [ROOT.GetNameDef] as a regional financial hub in order to insure our global relevance in this post-oil era.
GCC_migrant_rights코0=Migrant Rights
GCC_migrant_rights_desc코0=Our unique demographic situation warrants attention. While our economy depends on the continued influx of migrants from the rest of the Middle East and South Asia, some of our subjects fear a dilution of [ROOT.GetAdjective] identity. In addition, we have drawn criticism for the poor conditions in which many migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] work in and the limited legal protections our government offers them.
GCC_inclusive_policies코0=Inclusive Policies
GCC_inclusive_policies_desc코0=It is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to accept the centrality of immigrants in our society. We should do what we can to improve their living conditions and welcome them to this great country.
GCC_amend_the_kafala_system코0=Amend the Kafala System
GCC_amend_the_kafala_system_desc코0=The kafala system requires migrant laborers to have in-country sponsers, in practice making them heavily dependent on their employers, opening them up to exploitation and abuse. Naturally, attempts to reform this system will be met with opposition from our country's various employers of migrant labor.
GCC_minimum_wage코0=Minimum Wage
GCC_minimum_wage_desc코0=The lack of a minimum wage for migrant laborers has contributed to their poor living conditions and over-dependence on their employers. Their standard of living could be improved significantly by introducing one. However, this move will likely have an adverse effect on our economic activity.
GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship코0=Open Pathways to Citizenship
GCC_open_pathways_to_citizenship_desc코0=As long as migrants in [ROOT.GetNameDef] are denied citizenship they will remain subjugated and oppressed. We should make it easier for foreigners who have resided in this country for long enough to acquire citizenship. While this will increase our popularity with naturalized citizens, this policy will likely have the opposite effect on local residents, thereby increasing support for nativist political forces.
GCC_exclusive_policies코0=Exclusive Policies
GCC_exclusive_policies_desc코0=The flood of migrants coming into [ROOT.GetNameDef] is a threat to our culture and our identity. We should protect the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people from this threat.
GCC_reverse_naturalization코0=Reverse Naturalization
GCC_reverse_naturalization_desc코0=Although little naturalization of foreign migrants has taken place, we must revoke the citizenship of those foreigners who have managed to gain citizenship and prevent any further naturalization.
GCC_impose_quotas코0=Impose Quotas
GCC_impose_quotas_desc코0=We should limit the number of migrants coming into the country to reduce the rate at which [ROOT.GetAdjective] culture is being eroded.
GCC_maintain_exploitation코0=Maintain Exploitation
GCC_maintain_exploitation_desc코0=While we resent the corrupting influence of foreign migrants on our society and have done everything in our power to guard against the threat they pose, we must accept the necessity of foreign migrants for our continued economic growth.
GCC_accelerated_growth코0=Accelerated Growth
GCC_accelerated_growth_desc코0=Our decision to ignore pressure to reform the kafala system has allowed us to continue utilizing our migrant population to its fullest extent.
GCC_mass_deportation코0=Mass Deportation
GCC_mass_deportation_desc코0=Foreigners are a corrupting influence on our society and must be expelled for the good of the nation.
GCC_empower_the_mutaween코0=Favor Scripturalism
GCC_empower_the_mutaween_desc코0=The sharia is an important foundation of our legal system. However, there is more that we can do. The gradual, insidious encroachment of liberal values on our religious society must be stopped. Instead, we should fall back on the fundamental principles of sharia law.
GCC_weaken_the_mutaween코0=Favor Reformism
GCC_weaken_the_mutaween_desc코0=The gradual trend in recent years in the region has been towards social liberalization. Instead of resisting this trend we should do what we can to support it.
GCC_womens_rights코0=Women's Rights
GCC_womens_rights_desc코0=The fate of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s women lies, as it always has, in the hands of [ROOT.GetAdjective] men. We must decide whether we wish to change this state of affairs or preserve the patriarchal status quo. Regardless of the approach we take, the status of our women is central to our identity as a nation.
GCC_women_in_the_economy코0=Women in the Economy
GCC_women_in_the_economy_desc코0=Women have recently started to become more prominent in the business community, but this trend is still at an early stage. There is ample room for us to either support this trend or to combat it.
GCC_women_in_politics코0=Women in Politics
GCC_women_in_politics_desc코0=The vast majority of official posts remain filled by men. We must decide whether to strive for gender equality or to keep women out of the political sphere.
GCC_reform_personal_status_laws코0=Reform Personal Status Laws
GCC_reform_personal_status_laws_desc코0=The personal status laws are the area of our legal code that draws most upon sharia principles. As such, these laws heavily discriminate against women, for example by stating that legally a man is worth two women. Outdated laws like this should be revisited.
GCC_political_affairs코0=Political Affairs
GCC_political_affairs_desc코0=Our rule faces many threats. Pro-democracy activists, Islamist radicals and so on directly challenge the legitimacy of our government. Whether we should take the criticisms of these detractors on board or harshly clamp down upon them is up to us.
GCC_constitutional_monarchy코0=Constitutional Monarchy
GCC_constitutional_monarchy_desc코0=The time has come for the royal family to delegate some limited powers to an elected legislature. This will allow us to preserve our privileged position and the majority of our political authority while reducing pro-democracy pressure, at least for now.
GCC_universal_suffrage코0=Universal Suffrage
GCC_universal_suffrage_desc코0=Allowing the entirety of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] population to elect legislators will prevent accusations of discrimination and prejudice being made against our government.
GCC_permit_activism코0=Permit Activism
GCC_permit_activism_desc코0=While in the past we have not tolerated criticism of our government outside of controlled petitions, our position is secure enough for us to permit the operation of activist groups.
GCC_empower_parliament코0=Empower Parliament
GCC_empower_parliament_desc코0=Parliament remains constrained by our constitution, with the vast majority of authority remaining in the hands of the royal family. This has led to popular demands for more authority being delegated to our elected legislature, demands that we should listen to.
GCC_end_censorship코0=End Censorship
GCC_end_censorship_desc코0=While censorship does help guard against threats to our authority, it stifles constructive popular discourse and feeds resentment towards our government.
GCC_free_and_fair_elections코0=Fully Democratic Government
GCC_free_and_fair_elections_desc코0=While our reforms have led to a democratically-elected legislature that acts as a check on our power, we have so far maintained the royal family's control over the appointment of government officials. Popular calls for further democratization can no longer be ignored, and it is high time that we open these positions up to electoral contestation.
GCC_empower_baath_supporters코0=Empower Baath Supporters
GCC_empower_baath_supporters_desc코0=The once great Baath party and the Arab nationalist cause has suffered from division and defeat across the region. Now that we have opened up the political space in our country, we can make [ROOT.GetNameDef] a new base for the Baath party and its mix of socialist and nationalist ideology.
GCC_empower_shia_democrats코0=Empower Shia Democrats
GCC_empower_shia_democrats_desc코0=Our Shia citizens are clamoring for representation, and deservedly so. We should lend our support to the various pro-democracy groups that represent the Shia people.
GCC_empower_sunni_democrats코0=Empower Sunni Democrats
GCC_empower_sunni_democrats_desc코0=Pluralist Sunni Islam was one of the most prominent forms of opposition to our government during [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s period of authoritarian rule. The religious values of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as the close connections to the community through networks of informal support and welfare provision, reinforce their popular support.
GCC_empower_western_based_dissidents코0=Empower Liberals
GCC_empower_western_based_dissidents_desc코0=Some parties and activists have been influenced by the secular, liberal values of the West and therefore favor social liberalization, unlike the more socially conservative Islamist parties. Their values make them popular among the progressive youth but alienate older, conservative voters.
GCC_defensive_nationalism코0=Defensive Nationalism
GCC_defensive_nationalism_desc코0=Our state faces many external threats. The best way to respond to these threats is not to overstretch ourselves by getting involved overseas, but by focusing on defending our national borders and preserving our internal unity.
GCC_aggressive_nationalism코0=Aggressive Nationalism
GCC_aggressive_nationalism_desc코0=The best defense is a good offense. The state of [ROOT.GetNameDef] must be prepared to strike overseas in order to protect our national integrity.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric코0=Irredentist Rhetoric
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc코0=[irredentist_rhetoric_description]
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_BHR코0=The Baharna are a proud people spread across Eastern Arabia. They once ruled a vast territory that spanned the entirety of Eastern Arabia. Since then the Baharna have suffered from the oppression of foreign conquerers. The Al-Khalifa and Al-Saud dynasties have unjustly presided over and divided a once great people. Freed from their yoke, the people of Bahrain will be restored to their former glory.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_KUW코0=The 1922 Uqair Convention divided a portion of Kuwaiti territory between our government and that of Najd, modern day Saudi Arabia. This divided zone is rich in oil and the Saudis therefore currently possess oil wealth that is rightfully ours. We should take back the Saudi-controlled portion of the Divided Zone and the oil extraction opportunities that it confers.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_OMA코0=The Yemeni provinces of al-Mahrah and Hadramawt have close historical and cultural ties to the Omani province of Dhofar. These easterners are culturally and, in the case of, al-Mahrah, linguistically distinct from the rest of Yemen. Moreover, their ties to the Yemeni capital in the northwest are tenuous at best, and they would likely welcome Omani governance.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_QAT코0=Bahrain's ownership over the rightfully Qatari Hawar islands is an affront to our national pride. Our sovereignty over the islands could easily be restored in the event that Bahrain ceases to exist.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_SAU코0=Abdulaziz established what would become Saudi Arabia through an ambitious conquest of the Arabian peninsula. That conquest was necessarily limited at the time by British protection of the Emirates along the Eastern Arabian coast and the Hashemite kingdoms. Now that a check on our regional expansion no longer exists, we are free to unify the entirety of the Arabian peninsula under one banner.
GCC_irredentist_rhetoric_desc_UAE코0=Bahrain and Qatar should have joined the union that was formed in 1971 that established the United Arab Emirates. For our country to reach its fully glory, these two rogue emirates cannot be allowed to remain independent and should be restored to the union by force if necessary.
GCC_favor_khomeinism코0=Favor Khomeinism
GCC_favor_khomeinism_desc코0=The principle of wilayat al-faqih is a Shia principle popularized by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini which puts power in the hands of a faqih, or Islamic jurist. The principle is shared by groups allied to the Islamic Republic of Iran such as the various offshoots of Hezbollah, and as such binds together a Shia identity that transcends borders.
GCC_favor_the_shiraziyyin코0=Favor the Shiraziyyin
GCC_favor_the_shiraziyyin_desc코0=The Shiraziyyin, or followers of al-Shirazi, adhere to the teachings of the prominent Shia religious leader Mohammad al-Shirazi who fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini due to his opposition to wilayat al-faqih. As a result of this schism, Shirazi movements in the Gulf have usually sought autonomy from Iran and focused their attention on national issues rather than transnational ones.
GCC_maintain_tradition코0=Maintain Tradition
GCC_maintain_tradition_desc코0=Our liberalization of the political sphere does not mean that we should seek a complete departure from our local traditions in favor of a wholly Western, liberal society. Our state should continue to be governed in accordance with Islamic principles and the values of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people should be respected.
GCC_westernization_policies코0=Westernization Policies
GCC_westernization_policies_desc코0=[ROOT.GetAdjective] society cannot progress if it remains rooted in old-fashioned traditions. Our nation must undergo rapid liberalizing reforms in order to become a civilized member of the international community.
GCC_religious_subsidies코0=Religious Subsidies
GCC_religious_subsidies_desc코0=We should demonstrate our government's continued support for [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s religious institutions by providing them with government subsidies.
GCC_ideological_partners코0=Ideological Partners
GCC_ideological_partners_desc코0=The Middle East is a dangerous region. We are threatened on all sides by hostile forces and as such must strengthen our relations with states that share our ideological alignment.
GCC_establish_a_republic코0=Establish a Republic
GCC_establish_a_republic_desc코0=While we have tolerated the continuation of the monarchy in a symbolic capacity so far, their continued existence remains an affront to our democratic values. The people of [ROOT.GetNameDef] will never truly be free of their authoritarian legacy until they free themselves of the royal family.
GCC_preserve_the_royal_family코0=Preserve the Royal Family
GCC_preserve_the_royal_family_desc코0=The continued existence of the royal family clearly does not pose a threat to our democracy. All their authority has been stripped away, and their power over elected officials has been eliminated. Why jeopardize [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s stability by destroying an institution of this country that is still looked upon fondly by many?
GCC_break_the_religious_establishment코0=Break the Religious Establishment
GCC_break_the_religious_establishment_desc코0=For too long the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government's policy-making has been beholden to the ulema, or Muslim scholars, who have either supported or opposed government policies depending on their interpretation of Islamic law. While we have managed to liberalize our government significantly, the ulema remains a major obstacle to our society's progress, an obstacle that should be removed.
GCC_absolute_monarchy코0=Absolute Monarchy
GCC_absolute_monarchy_desc코0=The answer to criticism of our government is not to give in to the demands of dangerous populists by initiating democratic reforms. Instead, we should utilize the greater opportunities for societal control that the 21st century offers us to entrench our government's authority. Maintaining the absolute control of the monarchy over the country is the only way to preserve stability.
GCC_anti_corruption_drive코0=Anti-Corruption Drive
GCC_anti_corruption_drive_desc코0=Corruption is undeniably an issue in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. It may be to our benefit to go after those members of the royal family who are engaged in corrupt activities, especially those who pose the greatest threat to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s authority...
GCC_reinforce_tribal_ties코0=Reinforce Tribal Ties
GCC_reinforce_tribal_ties_desc코0=Our authority has always depended on the royal family's close links to the leaders of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s various tribes. In order to secure our rule we should make sure that these bonds are as strong as ever.
GCC_extend_control_over_the_ulema코0=Extend Control Over the Ulema
GCC_extend_control_over_the_ulema_desc코0=The ulema are an extremely influential part of [ROOT.GetAdjective] society and have served the interests of our government well in the past by issuing interpretations of Islamic law that justified our actions. However, they maintain a high degree of autonomy and as such may refuse to endorse certain policies. This autonomy must be eroded if the authority of the monarch is to remain supreme.
GCC_bolster_the_security_services코0=Bolster the Security Services
GCC_bolster_the_security_services_desc코0=Our country's police and intelligence services are indispensable for the security of our regime and, by extension, the safety of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. They should be given all the resources that they need to combat dangerous destabilizing elements in [ROOT.GetAdjective] society.
GCC_centralize_power코0=Centralize Power
GCC_centralize_power_desc코0=The biggest threat to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s authority comes not from jihadists or democrats but from rival members of the royal family. The sheer size of the royal family means that many figures opposed to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s rule have been able to retain their own power centers within the government. These alternative sources of authority must be eliminated.
GCC_pro_government_indoctrination코0=Pro-Government Indoctrination
GCC_pro_government_indoctrination_desc코0=The school and the mosque are key locations in which the opinions of [ROOT.GetAdjective]s are shaped and moulded. We should put pressure on these institutions to espouse pro-government views and instill a sense of patriotism in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people.
GCC_enhanced_surveillance코0=Constant Surveillance
GCC_enhanced_surveillance_desc코0=While the majority of [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s citizens are loyal and patriotic, we must keep a close eye on the entirety of our population to make sure that subversive elements do not emerge under our noses.
GCC_a_cult_of_personality코0=A Cult of Personality
GCC_a_cult_of_personality_desc코0=[ROOT.GetLeader] should not simply be feared by his enemies, but also loved by his people. Through the control over [ROOT.GetAdjective] society that we have secured we can convince the [ROOT.GetAdjective] population that this country's success and good fortune is tied directly to the guiding hand of our glorious leader, whose will is one with that of Allah.
GCC_build_a_totalitarian_state코0=Build a Totalitarian State
GCC_build_a_totalitarian_state_desc코0=Our consolidation of the state is now complete. We have built a society that unconditionally loves [ROOT.GetLeader] and his government. A society where any hint of rebellion is nipped in the bud and where loyalty to the royal family takes precedence above all else.
GCC_a_radical_reorientation코0=A Radical Reorientation
GCC_a_radical_reorientation_desc코0=Despite Islamic fundamentalism being considered a threat to the government and viewed with hostility by most of the elite, in some quarters there is quiet support for radical interpretations of the Qur'an, interpretations that challenge authority and call for the establishment of an Islamic state by force of arms.
GCC_covert_support_for_islamist_radicals코0=Covert Support
GCC_covert_support_for_islamist_radicals_desc코0=Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has long been active in the Gulf, though its activities have mainly been confined to Yemen. Through discrete channels we can provide funding to AQAP elements in Yemen to increase the viability of the movement.
GCC_tolerate_radical_preachers코0=Tolerate Radical Preachers
GCC_tolerate_radical_preachers_desc코0=The ulema includes a wide range of individuals with a similarly wide range of views. While the government has historically been wary of religious figures who make subversive statements, we can use our influence to ensure that the radical fringes of the ulema get a chance to air their views.
GCC_welcome_militants코0=Militant Influx
GCC_welcome_militants_desc코0=If we turn a blind eye to goings on at the border, who is to say whether a few undesirable, subversive elements manage to slip into [ROOT.GetNameDef] unnoticed?
GCC_arms_smuggling코0=Arms Smuggling
GCC_arms_smuggling_desc코0=For an uprising to be successful, the people must be armed. Luckily, our country is located within a number of transnational arms smuggling networks.
GCC_start_the_uprising코0=Fundamentalist Coup
GCC_start_the_uprising_desc코0=For too long our country has been governed by corrupt, decadent elites that have used the language of Islam to justify their continued grip over the power and resources that rightfully belong to the people. It is time for us to reclaim the mantle of al-Wahhab and wage an armed struggle against the decadent elite.
GCC_clamp_down_on_vices코0=Clamp Down on Vices
GCC_clamp_down_on_vices_desc코0=The decadent, westernized character of the previous government has produced a society that is morally corrupt and almost beyond redemption. It is our duty to try our best to redeem this country's inhabitants.
GCC_revolutionize_the_ulema코0=Revolutionize the Ulema
GCC_revolutionize_the_ulema_desc코0=Many of the ulema are quietly or, in some cases, vocally opposed to our interpretation of the Qur'an. These misguided ulema should be made to understand the error of their ways.
GCC_traditional_gender_roles코0=Traditional Gender Roles
GCC_traditional_gender_roles_desc코0=Certain aspects of society are not meant to be changed. The responsibilities of men and women respectively are clearly demarcated and not a matter for public debate.
GCC_pledge_allegiance_to_al_qaeda코0=Al-Qaeda HQ
GCC_pledge_allegiance_to_al_qaeda_desc코0=Now that we have established a safe haven for the faithful, the territory that we have taken control of can be a base for the regional and global activities of al-Qaeda.
GCC_pledge_allegiance_to_daesh코0=Pledge Allegiance to Islamic State
GCC_pledge_allegiance_to_daesh_desc코0=Al-Qaeda is a decrepit, decaying movement that has lost sight of its original goal to wage global jihad, instead getting bogged down in affairs at the local level. It is time for a new movement with a new sense of purpose to take its place.
GCC_secure_the_loyalty_of_ansar_al_sharia코0=Secure the Loyalty of Al-Qaeda Affiliates
GCC_secure_the_loyalty_of_ansar_al_sharia_desc코0=For years al-Qaeda has been supporting jihadist movements across the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. Now that we have established a base for al-Qaeda's global activity, it is high time that these allies of ours pledge their fighters to our cause.
GCC_jihad_in_arabia코0=Jihad in Arabia
GCC_jihad_in_arabia_desc코0=As the home of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, the Arabian peninsula is perhaps the most religiously significant territory in the world. It therefore cannot be allowed to continue to be governed by insufficiently pious, corrupt governments.
GCC_jihad_in_the_levant코0=Jihad in Iraq and al-Sham
GCC_jihad_in_the_levant_desc코0=Iraq and the Levant are regions that have been torn apart by foreign forces since the colonial era. It is only through force of arms that the Crusader and Zionist occupiers in the Levant can be expelled.
GCC_jihad_in_the_maghreb코0=Jihad in the Maghreb
GCC_jihad_in_the_maghreb_desc코0=The North African states of the Maghreb has seen our jihadist brothers suffer under the brutal oppression of Western-backed regimes. We must free them from their suffering as soon as possible and put an end to the jahiliyyah that plagues North Africa.
GCC_jihad_in_west_africa코0=Jihad in the Sahel
GCC_jihad_in_west_africa_desc코0=The Sahel is a region plagued by food insecurity, drought and corrupt governance. It is therefore a region that demands liberation and one where we will find many Muslims eager to join our cause.
GCC_war_on_daesh코0=War on Daesh
GCC_war_on_daesh_desc코0=The so-called "Islamic State" is a clear threat to our leadership of the global jihadist movement. Their rejection of our authority and their unconventional tactics can be tolerated no longer. It is time for us to wage all out war against the upstart Daesh.
GCC_foreign_affairs코0=Foreign Affairs
GCC_foreign_affairs_desc코0=While we have not historically needed to get heavily involved in regional politics, given the security provided to us by first the British and then the Americans, perhaps the time has come for us to take a more proactive approach towards foreign policy.
GCC_influence_muslim_europe코0=Influence Muslim Europe
GCC_influence_muslim_europe_desc코0=The Ottoman Empire's expansion into Europe has left a footprint on that continent in the form of several Muslim majority nations. While many of the Muslims in these countries adopt a very different approach to their faith compared to Muslims in our country, we can still use our common religion as a basis for extending our influence into this region.
GCC_befriend_the_turks코0=Befriend the Turks
GCC_befriend_the_turks_desc코0=[befriend_the_turks_description]
GCC_befriend_the_turks_desc_not_saudi코0=Turkey is a growing regional power, and one that it may be beneficial for us to deepen our cooperation with. In the face of [SAU.GetNameDef]'s regional ambitions, a counterweight to Saudi influence in the Gulf will provide us with much-needed flexibility and place a check on Saudi expansion.
GCC_befriend_the_turks_desc_saudi코0=While in the past we have been wary of any Turkish presence in our immediate sphere of influence, it may serve our interests better to pursue dialogue with the Turks. Encouraging Turkey to sympathize with us rather than the Persians will help contain the ultimately more important Iranian threat.
GCC_contain_the_turks코0=Contain the Turks
GCC_contain_the_turks_desc코0=We cannot allow Turkey to pursue its interests in the Middle East. [TUR.GetLeader]'s support of political Islam risks strengthening a dangerous populist movement, one that may seek to overthrow our government.
GCC_turkish_bases코0=Turkish Bases
GCC_turkish_bases_desc코0=As part of our strengthening of relations with the Turks, we should invite [TUR.GetLeader] to establish a Turkish military base on our territory. Not only will this help further improve relations between our two countries, but it will also help strengthen our security against external threats given Turkey's incentive to protect its new military base.
GCC_security_guarantees_turkey코0=Security Guarantees
GCC_security_guarantees_turkey_desc코0=Now that our relations with Turkey have grown exceptionally close, perhaps it is time for us to negotiate a treaty where both of our countries guarantee the other's sovereignty. This will certainly help ward off any hostile forces that may threaten either us or our new allies.
GCC_sanction_turkey코0=Sanction Turkey
GCC_sanction_turkey_desc코0=Despite our warnings Turkey has continued to meddle in the Arab world. We have no choice but to use coercive measures to dissuade Turkey from furthering its imperialist ambitions.
GCC_influence_the_levant코0=Influence Iraq and al-Sham
GCC_influence_the_levant_desc코0=Iraq and the Levant is home to multiple opportunities for cooperation as well as threats to contain. Located at the intersection between several spheres of influence, it is a region that we cannot afford to ignore.
GCC_back_the_syrian_opposition코0=Arm the Opposition
GCC_back_the_syrian_opposition_desc코0=[SYR.GetLeader] is a brutal dictator but also, more importantly, a threat to our interests in the region. We should send support to opposition groups who could rid the region of this menace.
GCC_intervene_in_syria코0=Topple Assad
GCC_intervene_in_syria_desc코0=The revolution is underway. We should guarantee its success by pushing for the deployment of boots on the ground. If we play our cards right, those boots could be American ones rather than our own. Undermining the Syrian regime would remove a key Iranian ally and backer of Hezbollah, and pave the way for the establishment of a government that is receptive of [ROOT.GetAdjective] interests.
GCC_denounce_the_opposition코0=Abandon the Opposition
GCC_denounce_the_opposition_desc코0=It is unwise for a government like ours, one that is subject to the same terrorist threats as that of Syria, to continue to support an opposition movement that contains dangerous extremist elements.
GCC_rapprochement_with_the_regime코0=Rapprochement with the Regime
GCC_rapprochement_with_the_regime_desc코0=The tide of the war in Syria has started to turn against the opposition. It would be in our interests to mend relations with a government that we will realistically have to engage with for years to come.
GCC_jordanian_ties코0=Sideline the Palestinians
GCC_jordanian_ties_desc코0=Ultimately campaigning for the Palestinian cause serves little geopolitical purpose. Rigidly sticking to the pro-Palestinian line has prevented us from cooperating with Israel, a state with which we share many common enemies. However, sidelining the Palestinians will undoubtedly be resisted our population, who remain overwhelmingly anti-Zionist.
GCC_pressure_lebanon코0=Pressure Lebanon
GCC_pressure_lebanon_desc코0=While our relations with the Lebanese have historically been good, we can no longer ignore the Lebanese government's tolerance of Hezbollah, a dangerous terrorist organization backed by Iran. We should put pressure on Lebanon to distance itself from the Iranian sphere of influence.
GCC_grant_recognition코0=Grant Recognition
GCC_grant_recognition_desc코0=Most of the Muslim world has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the state of Israel. This lack of recognition has hampered the improvement of relations between us and the Israelis, and it is therefore in our interest to break with the rest of the Muslim world in recognizing Israel, signalling our desire for closer cooperation with the Jewish state.
GCC_secret_cooperation코0=Secret Cooperation
GCC_secret_cooperation_desc코0=Israel is the most technologically advanced nation in the Middle East. Secretly negotiating an agreement to share military technology between our two countries will undoubtedly help enhance our own capabilities, as well as deepen our cooperation with the IDF, the force in the Middle East that is the most capable of finishing Hezbollah off once and for all and resisting the growing Persian threat.
GCC_war_with_hezbollah코0=War with Hezbollah
GCC_war_with_hezbollah_desc코0=Hezbollah has been a tool of Iranian foreign policy for years, one that has sought to subvert and challenge the rule of governments like ours by encouraging revolutionary sentiments among Shia minorities across the region. Our hostility to Hezbollah is shared by Israel, who have suffered from raids and indiscriminate attacks on their territory. We are therefore natural allies against Hezbollah.
GCC_host_talks코0=An Impartial Arbiter
GCC_host_talks_desc코0=When it comes to peace between Israel and Palestine, many have tried. All have failed. We should use our political capital to make a fresh attempt to bring about peace in the Middle East by crafting a proposal that is acceptable to both sides.
GCC_cash_for_land코0=Cash for Land
GCC_cash_for_land_desc코0=When it comes to issues as emotive as Israeli settlements and Palestinian refugees, cold hard cash may seem an inappropriate solution. Nonetheless, financial compensation is a point that our peace proposal depends on, and as such we must be willing to put up the funds necessary to compensate and support the resettlement of hundreds of thousands, even millions of people.
GCC_peace_in_the_middle_east코0=Peace in the Middle East
GCC_peace_in_the_middle_east_desc코0=Our peace proposal, not too long ago, was met with snorts of derision in Washington, London, Moscow and beyond. But we have achieved what every international mediator has so far failed to do - peace between Israel and Palestine. From this point on, [FROM.GetName] will forever be associated with shrewd diplomacy and the betterment of millions of lives.
GCC_favor_resistance코0=Support a Free Palestine
GCC_favor_resistance_desc코0=The Palestinians have been cursed with statelessness, their plight serving as a constant reminder of the failures of the international community. The brutality of the Israeli occupation and the tacit abandonment of the Palestinian cause by Arab governments has left the Palestinians alone and without an ally to depend on. We could be that ally.
GCC_live_and_let_live코0=Support Lebanon
GCC_live_and_let_live_desc코0=Lebanon is a country that has suffered from decades of internal division. We should support its government as much as we can rather than impose unrealistic expectations on this fragile state.
GCC_support_hamas코0=Arms for Hamas
GCC_support_hamas_desc코0=The Oslo Accords of 1993 and its subsequent failure has significantly damaged the reputation of the mainstream Palestinian nationalist movement at the expense of their Islamist rivals, Hamas. Hamas is therefore the Palestinian actor that we should throw our support behind to undermine Israel.
GCC_combat_saudi_influence코0=Criticize the Occupation
GCC_combat_saudi_influence_desc코0=Regrettably, many Arab states have chosen to avoid making overt condemnations of Israel to avoid negatively impacting diplomatic relations. We should make no such consideration, and condemn the illegal Israeli occupation in the strongest terms possible.
GCC_back_an_intifada코0=Back an Intifada
GCC_back_an_intifada_desc코0=The Palestinian people demand to be heard. An Intifada will remind the world that their suffering is not to be tolerated and show Israel that their occupation of Palestine is not sustainable.
GCC_war_with_israel코0=War with Israel
GCC_war_with_israel_desc코0=The Intifada has given us further evidence that there is no limits to Israel's brutality. We cannot simply sit by and watch as the Palestinian people are mercilessly slaughtered.
GCC_forge_an_independent_path코0=Regional Upheaval
GCC_forge_an_independent_path_desc코0=For years a shadow has loomed over the Middle East. The previous government of our country did little to challenge the injustice of American interference in the Middle East and through their inaction failed the [ROOT.GetAdjective] people. It is time for us to pursue a different, more radical path and reshape the Middle East in our image.
GCC_strategic_hedging코0=Strategic Hedging
GCC_strategic_hedging_desc코0=The Middle East is the site of contestation between many great powers. It is in our best interests to pursue a foreign policy that balances these powers against one another and affords us the maximum flexibility possible.
GCC_keep_to_the_saudi_line코0=Keep to the Status Quo
GCC_keep_to_the_saudi_line_desc코0=We have historically benefited from maintaining a close partnership with first the British, and then the Americans. We see no reason to jeopardize our security by throwing away our ties to the West. This partnership, however, should not be interpreted as dependence. We must maintain our own capacity to act against those who would do us harm, as our Western allies may not always come to our aid.
GCC_improve_relations_with_iran코0=Improve Relations With Iran
GCC_improve_relations_with_iran_desc코0=Iran is too significant a power to ignore. While our foreign and domestic allies may oppose an improvement of relations with Iran, for now we should focus on diplomatic pragmatism and deal with the potential repercussions of our foreign policy shift later.
GCC_the_arab_street코0=The Arab Street
GCC_the_arab_street_desc코0=Across the Arab world there is has been a historical discrepancy between policies of governments and the views of their people. When it comes to the Israel-Palestine issue, relations with the United States, political Islam and democratization, there are few Arab governments with the bravery to translate public opinion into foreign policy. We can be the ones to change this state of affairs.
GCC_non_aggression_pact코0=Invite the Quds Force
GCC_non_aggression_pact_desc코0=Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 the Islamic Republic has pursued an interventionist foreign policy that relies on backing allied states and armed groups to contain Iran's enemies and extend its own influence. We should support Iran in this endeavor and allow our territory to be used as a base for the activities of Iran's infamous Quds force.
GCC_align_with_iran코0=Undermine Neighbors
GCC_align_with_iran_desc코0=The Shia of the Arabian Gulf have long been oppressed by hostile monarchies. We should encourage these oppressed minorities to agitate against their governments.
GCC_antagonize_iran코0=Antagonize Iran
GCC_antagonize_iran_desc코0=Since 1979 the Arab monarchies have faced an existential threat in the form of the Islamic Republic of Iran. While at times relations have been lukewarm, we have always understood that Iran's revolutionary brand of political Islam threatens the stability of the region and, by extension, our own government.
GCC_combat_iranian_influence코0=Combat Iranian Influence
GCC_combat_iranian_influence_desc코0=Iran's influence has been growing in both Sunni and Shia states alike. We should use our own influence to resist Iran's attempts at soft power expansion or face an extension of Iran's so-called "Resistance Axis" and the Shia Crescent.
GCC_denounce_iranian_meddling코0=Denounce Iranian Meddling
GCC_denounce_iranian_meddling_desc코0=We cannot simply allow Iran to run amok in the region without voicing our discontent. The inaction of our allies is what has contributed to this lamentable state of affairs, so we must take it upon ourselves to step up and denounce the Persian threat.
GCC_confront_iranian_partners코0=Blockade Persian Partners
GCC_confront_iranian_partners_desc코0=The Gulf Cooperation Council was envisioned as a united front against common threats to the Arab monarchies of the Gulf. This unity has been fractured by differing approaches towards the threat posed by Iran, with some of our erstwhile partners pursuing amicable relations with our deadly enemy. This can be tolerated no longer.
GCC_the_war_within코0=War in the Arabian Peninsula
GCC_the_war_within_desc코0=The Gulf Cooperation Council has become a hollow shell of regional cooperation. Regrettably, we have no choice now but to settle our differences with our neighbors and former friends through violent means.
GCC_strengthen_us_ties코0=Strengthen US Ties
GCC_strengthen_us_ties_desc코0=America and [ROOT.GetNameDef] may seem likely unlikely allies given our vastly different regime types, but our regional interests are remarkably similar. We should reinforce a partnership which has done nothing but support our national interests and regional security. Even if some [ROOT.GetAdjective]s resent this special relationship, it is one that we cannot do without.
GCC_mass_arms_purchases코0=Secure American Protection
GCC_mass_arms_purchases_desc코0=America has rhetorically supported our security in the past and came to our defence during the Gulf War, demonstrating its commitment to Middle Eastern stability. However, before we pursue a more active foreign policy in the region we should first secure a firm American commitment to come to our defence in the event of an external attack.
GCC_amplify_sectarian_rhetoric코0=Amplify Sectarian Rhetoric
GCC_amplify_sectarian_rhetoric_desc코0=Sectarianism, despite what Western media may suggest, is not a permanent feature of Middle Eastern politics. Nonetheless, recent events have indeed exacerbated tensions between Sunni and Shia across the region, tensions that provide us with a useful opportunity to undermine Shia Iran.
GCC_support_iranian_separatists코0=Support Iranian Separatists
GCC_support_iranian_separatists_desc코0=Iran's struggles with various separatist movements predate the Islamic Republic. Azeris, Arabs, Balochis and Kurds have all struggled against the discrimination of Tehran in their efforts to achieve greater autonomy. Arabs and Balochis in particular make for natural allies, the former due to our ethnic affinity, the latter due to our shared Sunni identity.
GCC_behead_the_snake코0=Behead the Snake
GCC_behead_the_snake_desc코0=The Americans must be made aware of the threat that Iran poses to both of our nations. The country's nuclear program, its support for subversive elements across the region, and its radical, extremist ideology demand a rapid and decisive armed response. We should make it clear to the United States that they must either cut off the head of the snake that is the Islamic Republic of Iran, or risk destruction.
GCC_distance_from_america코0=Distance from America
GCC_distance_from_america_desc코0=We can no longer ignore the growing pressure from our population to reduce our dependence on the United States for our security. It is time for us to adopt a radically different approach to our foreign policy, one that will free [ROOT.GetNameDef] from neo-imperial domination.
GCC_expel_us_interests코0=Expel US Interests
GCC_expel_us_interests_desc코0=US troops are resented, even hated, by the people of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. The Americans must be made to leave our country so that they cannot continue to use it as a staging ground for their imperial ambitions.
GCC_friendship_with_russia코0=Friendship with Russia
GCC_friendship_with_russia_desc코0=Russia lacks the hegemonic heft of the United States, meaning that while it cannot guarantee our security to the same extent that the US could it does not share America's imperialist aspirations. A security partnership with Russia will therefore be more equitable and less unpopular with the [ROOT.GetAdjective] public.
GCC_invite_russian_advisors코0=Invite Russian Advisors
GCC_invite_russian_advisors_desc코0=The Russian military has centuries of expertise at its disposal, expertise that we could benefit from by inviting Russian advisors to train our own armed forces.
GCC_russian_bases코0=Russian Bases
GCC_russian_bases_desc코0=Allowing Russia to establish military bases in our territory would serve both our countries' interests. Russia would gain a useful base of operations in a strategically important region and we, for our part, would gain a greater commitment to our security from our newfound ally.
GCC_reject_foreign_interference코0=Reject Foreign Interference
GCC_reject_foreign_interference_desc코0=The Middle East has for decades been governed by collaborationist governments dependent on foreign powers for their revenue and security. The people of the region are clamoring for a change to the status quo, a process that we can begin in earnest in [ROOT.GetNameDef] by decoupling ourselves from foreign influence.
GCC_attack_foreign_stooges코0=Demand the Expulsion of Foreign Troops
GCC_attack_foreign_stooges_desc코0=Many countries host military bases for foreign nations with imperial aspirations in the region. Whether it is American or Russian troops that these countries host on their soil, they must order them to leave immediately or face the consequences.
GCC_war_with_imperialism코0=War on Imperialism
GCC_war_with_imperialism_desc코0=Unfortunately we have yet to bring about the liberation of the Muslim and Arab peoples of the region, as foreign troops continue to occupy land that is rightfully ours. The only option that remains available to us is to drive them out by force and overthrow the puppet governments that host them.
GCC_influence_north_africa코0=Influence North Africa
GCC_influence_north_africa_desc코0=North Africa, particularly the countries of the Maghreb, has traditionally been somewhat detached from the politics of the Middle East, maintaining stronger ties to Europe in the north and sub-Saharan Africa in the south. However, given the increasing geopolitical rivalry taking place in our immediate sphere of influence, it may be worth bolstering our involvement in this region.
GCC_algerian_ties코0=Side with Algeria
GCC_algerian_ties_desc코0=Algeria and Morocco have, since independence, competed for dominance and clashing repeatedly. This animosity makes it exceedingly difficult to maintain good relations with both simultaneously. Improving relations with Algeria may be in our interest due to that country's extensive experience fighting Islamist rebels, experience that we can draw upon.
GCC_moroccan_ties코0=Side with Morocco
GCC_moroccan_ties_desc코0=Algeria and Morocco have, since independence, competed for dominance and clashing repeatedly. This animosity makes it exceedingly difficult to maintain good relations with both simultaneously. Being a monarchy rather than a republic, Morocco is the more natural partner for us and our relations have therefore been strong in the past.
GCC_aid_sudan코0=Aid Sudan
GCC_aid_sudan_desc코0=Sudan's Islamist government has historically leant towards Iran given the two states' ideological affinity. However, this relationship has done little to support Sudan's ailing economy which has suffered under Western sanctions since the late 90s. We can help secure a Sudanese realignment by providing the economic support that Iran has been unable to offer.
GCC_sanction_sudan코0=Sanction Sudan
GCC_sanction_sudan_desc코0=[SUD.GetLeader]'s leadership has been plagued by international controversy. Under his rule, Sudan has been accused of being a state sponser of terror as well as a major human rights abuser. Western nations have subsequently sanctioned this rogue state, an example that we should follow.
GCC_back_the_strongman코0=Back the Strongman
GCC_back_the_strongman_desc코0=Egypt is governed best when it is under the control of a single, strong leader backed up by one of the most powerful militaries in the Middle East. We should continue to support stability and secular rule in this key Arab country, along with a regional order that favors American-backed autocracy over destabilizing democracy.
GCC_back_the_brotherhood코0=Back the Brotherhood
GCC_back_the_brotherhood_desc코0=Egypt, as the birthplace of the Muslim Brotherhood, is a symbolically significant arena for the battle between secular authoritarianism and Islamist democracy, a battle that we should formulate a position on. The Brotherhood, which enjoys a strong following across the region, may be a useful conduit for our overseas influence.
GCC_war_in_libya코0=Libyan Arms Shipments
GCC_war_in_libya_desc코0=For much of its history Libya has been a site of foreign contestation. Italy, Britain, Russia and the United States vied for influence in the pre-Qaddafi Libya, attempting to benefit from the country's strategic location and high quality oil deposits. However, the West's diminished involvement in the country has offered regional powers like ourselves an opportunity to shape Libyan politics to our advantage.
GCC_influence_south_asia코0=Influence South Asia
GCC_influence_south_asia_desc코0=To the East lies a region rich in history and culture, one which once boasted one of the most powerful Muslim empires in the history of the world. Today the Indian subcontinent suffers from a bitter rivalry between India and Pakistan. This rivalry means that we must be careful about our diplomatic overtures, as there is only so far that we can improve relations with one side without antagonizing the other.
GCC_affirm_pakistani_ties코0=Affirm Pakistani Ties
GCC_affirm_pakistani_ties_desc코0=As one of the largest Muslim-majority countries in the world, Pakistan is a country that has cultural, economic and geopolitical value to us. We should therefore ensure that our ties with the Pakistanis are as strong as they possibly can be.
GCC_oil_refineries_in_pakistan코0=Oil Refineries in Pakistan
GCC_oil_refineries_in_pakistan_desc코0=Our decades of experience with oil means that we can offer our Pakistani partners useful technical know-how regarding the refining of crude oil. This cooperation improve our relations with Pakistan as well as help support Pakistan's growing economy.
GCC_deepen_military_cooperation코0=Deepen Military Cooperation
GCC_deepen_military_cooperation_desc코0=The Pakistani military is one of the most experienced and well-trained militaries in the Muslim world. We can benefit from this expertise and experience by ramping up our military cooperation with our Pakistani partner. However, this cooperation will prevent us from pursuing closer ties to Pakistan's bitter rival.
GCC_security_guarantees코0=Security Guarantees
GCC_security_guarantees_desc코0=Now that relations with Pakistan have been substantially strengthened, we can bind our two nations together with security guarantees. From this day forward, [ROOT.GetNameDef] and Pakistan will not simply be close partners, but also strong allies.
GCC_draw_closer_to_india코0=Draw Closer to India
GCC_draw_closer_to_india_desc코0=While we have traditionally had closer ties to Pakistan, India is too large a military and economic power for us to ignore. We should therefore persue amicable relations with India, even as we continue to maintain ties to its most hated enemy.
GCC_improve_trade_relations코0=Improve Trade Relations
GCC_improve_trade_relations_desc코0=India's massive population means that it has a similarly massive market for our exports. It would therefore be wise for us to strenghten our trading partnership with this economic powerhouse.
GCC_end_the_special_relationship코0=End the Special Relationship
GCC_end_the_special_relationship_desc코0=While our ties with Pakistan may have served us well in the past, the time has come for us to make a choice between preserving our relationship with Pakistan and pursuing closer ties to its larger rival.
GCC_indian_bases코0=Indian Bases
GCC_indian_bases_desc코0=Having thrown our lot in with India as opposed to Pakistan, it would make sense for us to cement our alliance with the Indians by giving them permission to establish military bases in our territory. Doing so will not only produce tangible signs of our close partnership, but will also give India a compelling reason to remain invested in our security.
GCC_military_affairs코0=Military Affairs
GCC_military_affairs_desc코0=In an increasingly unstable region it remains to be seen whether we can continue to depend on the United States for our security. We should build up our own capabilities in order to be ready for any threat to our sovereignty and territorial integrity.
GCC_equipment_modernizations코0=Equipment Modernizations
GCC_equipment_modernizations_desc코0=Our Cold War-era stockpiles are increasingly falling behind global standards. We should do what we can to keep the equipment of our armed forces up to date.
GCC_foreign_procurement코0=Foreign Procurement
GCC_foreign_procurement_desc코0=Realistically we will never be able to develop an arms industry like that of Russia and the United States. We should therefore continue to import our arms from technologically superior nations.
GCC_ak103코0=Order AK-103s
GCC_ak103_desc코0=Our aging service rifles demand a more advanced replacement. The AK-103 is a modern iteration of the infamous Kalashnikov assault rifle, chambered for the 7.62x39mm round. It is a product of the same expert Russian engineering that produced the AK-47 and a whole host of other small arms that have shaped modern battlefields.
GCC_m4코0=Order M4 Carbines
GCC_m4_desc코0=Our aging service rifles demand a more advanced replacement. The M4 carbine is a compact AR-15 derivative that remains widely used in the United States Army and Marine Corps, as well as US-allied militaries all around the globe. It is therefore an appropriate weapon for our forces to adopt.
GCC_kobra코0=Order Cobras
GCC_kobra_desc코0=The Turkish Otokar Cobra is a robust and dependable vehicle that has received substantial global attention and export success. In addition, it is relatively more affordable than some of its competitors.
GCC_matv코0=Order M-ATVs
GCC_matv_desc코0=The Oshkosh M-ATV is an American Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle designed to replace the United States military's large stockpile of Humvees. It has significantly improved upon flaws that American servicemen and women encountered in its predecessor.
GCC_f35코0=Go with the F-35
GCC_f35_desc코0=The F-35 Lighting II is the result of a long and costly American program to produce a new fifth generation stealth fighter. It has been heavily sought after by a number of US allies, and for good reason. We should follow suit and seek to procure this advanced multirole fighter for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Air Force to supplement our aging aircraft inventory.
GCC_eurofighter코0=Go with the Eurofighter
GCC_eurofighter_desc코0=The Eurofighter Typhoon was an ambitious multinational project that involved the aeronautical expertise of the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain. It is an effective and widely used air superiority fighter and would therefore make a worthy addition to our aircraft inventory.
GCC_rafale코0=Go with the Rafale
GCC_rafale_desc코0=France originally took part in the Eurofighter Typhoon project, but following disagreements with the project's other participants, France broke away and started pursuing its own fighter program. This program produced the Dassault Rafale, an advanced aircraft that would be an effective but affordable supplement to our existing aircraft inventory.
GCC_su57코0=Go with the Su-57
GCC_su57_desc코0=The Sukhoi Su-57 is a much anticipated fifth-generation jet fighter currently being developed by the Russian Federation. The Su-57 will be the first Russian aircraft to utilize stealth technology and will replace the MiG-29 and Su-27 in Russian service. This highly advanced nature aircraft is the Russian counterpart to the American F-35, despite differences in their intended role and design.
GCC_local_arms_industry코0=Local Arms Industry
GCC_local_arms_industry_desc코0=While in the past we relied on imported weapons, increasing regional insecurity means that we should consider developing our own arms industry in order to maximize our self-sufficiency in the event of an outbreak of armed conflict.
GCC_domestic_rifle_designs코0=[ROOT.GetAdjective] Rifle Designs
GCC_domestic_rifle_designs_desc코0=Our existing service rifles are decades old and in need of replacement. Instead of importing more small arms from abroad and perpetuating are dependency on foreign suppliers, we should instead develop our own service rifle.
GCC_armored_vehicles코0=[ROOT.GetAdjective] Armor
GCC_armored_vehicles_desc코0=In order to reduce our reliance on foreign imports, we should support our local arms industry by promoting the development of domestic armored vehicles.
GCC_corvette_program코0=Naval Program
GCC_corvette_program_desc코0=Our navy has historically relied on ships manufactured abroad. However, now that we have started to develop our own naval industry we can supplement this inventory with locally designed and manufactured ships.
GCC_expanded_recruitment코0=Expanded Recruitment
GCC_expanded_recruitment_desc코0=Our military is relatively small due to our historical reliance on the United States for our security. However, even in the event that the United States continues to be a reliable guarantor of our security, we should have a sufficiently large military to delay any invasion of our territory long enough for help to arrive.
GCC_a_streamlined_military코0=A Streamlined Military
GCC_a_streamlined_military_desc코0=While a large military has its advantages, the nature of modern warfare means that a slimmer, more efficient and better coordinated military may suit the needs of [ROOT.GetNameDef] better.
GCC_asymmetric_warfare코0=Revolution in Military Affairs
GCC_asymmetric_warfare_desc코0=Following the end of the Cold War the world's militaries have started shifting away from large-scale conventional warfare in favor of smaller, more mobile forces that rely on close cooperation between different military branches and usage of advanced technology. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] military should adapt itself to comply with this trend.
GCC_radar_improvements코0=Radar Improvements
GCC_radar_improvements_desc코0=Radar is an essential component of our national defence, and an area that has not been historically given the attention that it deserves. Furthermore, improving our radar capabilities can support further technological improvements.
GCC_develop_indigenous_drone_capability코0=Develop Indigenous Drone Capability
GCC_develop_indigenous_drone_capability_desc코0=Unmanned aerial vehicles are widely praised as the future of modern warfare. We should make our own contribution to this relatively new industry.
GCC_chinese_uavs코0=Chinese UAVs
GCC_chinese_uavs_desc코0=The CAIG Wing Loong, also known as the Chengdu Pterodactyl I, is China's low-cost contribution to the UAV market. Importing the Wing Loong would give our military UAV capability far quicker than if we were to attempt to develop our own platform.
GCC_expand_special_forces코0=Expand Special Forces
GCC_expand_special_forces_desc코0=Increasingly protecting our national interests have required surgical interventions into high-risk environments. In situations where personnel on the ground are necessary, these are tasks which special operations forces are best suited for.
GCC_counterinsurgency_tactics코0=Counter-Insurgency Tactics
GCC_counterinsurgency_tactics_desc코0=The majority of threats to our government come from non-state groups rather than conventional state actors. This means that our Cold War-era focus on countering state threats is no longer sufficient, and should be supplemented by a comprehensive strategy to address insurgencies.
GCC_improve_targeting코0=Improve Targeting
GCC_improve_targeting_desc코0=Modern battlegrounds are environments in which the identification of targets is often extremely difficult without spotters on the ground. We should do what we can to improve out targeting capabilities.
GCC_precision_air_strikes코0=Precision Air Strikes
GCC_precision_air_strikes_desc코0=Fighting in urban areas is fraught with risks. If not enough due diligence is taken, what could at a distance appear to be a military target may in fact be a civilian one. We should ensure that our air strikes are as precise as possible in order to minimize collateral damage and better comply with our obligations under international humanitarian law.
GCC_a_modern_military코0=A Modern Military
GCC_a_modern_military_desc코0=Now that we have bolstered the capabilties and technological assets of elements within our armed forces, we can complete the modernization of the rest of our armed forces by focusing on network-centric warfare.
GCC_military_industry_investments코0=Military Industry Investments
GCC_military_industry_investments_desc코0=It will not be possible for us to produce our own equipment on a significant enough scale without first investing into our arms industry.
GCC_naval_industry_investments코0=Naval Industry Investments
GCC_naval_industry_investments_desc코0=Despite the importance of maritime security to the structure of our economy, we have as yet failed to invest significant resources into developing an independent naval capability, as our existing ships are all manufactured by foreign defense contractors. We should address this issue by investing in our own shipbuilding capability,
GCC_improve_sam_sites코0=Improve SAM Sites
GCC_improve_sam_sites_desc코0=Surface-to-air missiles are an important part of Anti Access/Area Denial (A2AD), restricting the ability of foreign forces to operate within our airspace.
GCC_expand_air_bases코0=Expand Air Bases
GCC_expand_air_bases_desc코0=A modern and effective air force is essential to 21st century combat. While we do have some of the infrastructure necessary to support such an air force, improving the capacity of this infrastructure will allow us to improve upon our existing aerial capabilities.
GCC_shia코0=The Shia Population
GCC_shia_desc코0=Following the death of the Prophet, a split emerged between those members of the Muslim community who wished to be led by prominent clerics and those who wished to be led by relatives of the Prophet. The former would become known as Sunnis, the latter as Shia, producing a religious split within the Muslim community that persists to this day.
GCC_appease_the_shia코0=Appease the Shia
GCC_appease_the_shia_desc코0=In order to foster a strong, united [ROOT.GetName], it would be best for us to pursue a conciliatory approach towards our Shia population, ensuring that they feel included in our society.
GCC_subsidize_shia_mosques코0=Subsidize Shia Mosques
GCC_subsidize_shia_mosques_desc코0=Simply tolerating the right of the Shia to practice their faith is not sufficient. We should demonstrate our government's commitment to their wellbeing by subsidizing the construction of mosques for them to worship in.
GCC_employment_opportunities코0=Employment Opportunities
GCC_employment_opportunities_desc코0=One grievance of the Shia is a lack of job opportunities in the public sector, leading to allegations of Sunni favoritism. In order to address these accusations, we should open up more public sector jobs for members of the Shia faith.
GCC_condemn_anti_shia_preachers코0=Condemn Anti-Shia Preachers
GCC_condemn_anti_shia_preachers_desc코0=There are unfortunately some Sunni clerics, particularly those with puritanical Salafi leanings, that target our Shia community with hate speech, encouraging discrimination against them and stigmatizing their way of life. While it would be best for us not to muzzle these clerics, we should make sure to distance our government from their views.
GCC_release_dissidents코0=Release Dissidents
GCC_release_dissidents_desc코0=Some Shia dissidents have been imprisoned by the security services for criticizing our government. It would be best for us to release these dissidents as a goodwill gesture to the community, so long as they do not advocate the overthrowing of our government by force.
GCC_fair_representation코0=Fair Representation
GCC_fair_representation_desc코0=Now that we have made our system of government more open and nclusive, it is possible for the Shia members of our community to be fairly represented by their government.
GCC_shia_dominance코0=Shia Dominance
GCC_shia_dominance_desc코0=Now that a government representing the interests of the Shia people has finally taken power in [ROOT.GetNameDef], we can establish a state that prioritizes their interests above all others. While Sunnis can still be a part of our society, they must accept that their beliefs will put them at a disadvantage.
GCC_rally_sunnis코0=Rally Sunnis
GCC_rally_sunnis_desc코0=The Shia that live among us are a threat to the unity of our nation. We should rally the people of [ROOT.GetNameDef] around our collective Sunni identity against those who would seek to undermine that identity.
GCC_counter_terror_operations코0=Raid Hideouts
GCC_counter_terror_operations_desc코0=Shia terrorists are an omnipresent threat to [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s security and the lives of its people. We should step up raids targeting suspected terrorists so as to protect our people from harm.
GCC_arrest_prominent_shia_clerics코0=Arrest Prominent Shia Clerics
GCC_arrest_prominent_shia_clerics_desc코0=The foremost Shia figures criticizing our government are religious leaders who use their platform to fabricate lies about our government. These Shia clerics cannot be allowed to continue preaching hatred against our government.
GCC_inflame_rhetoric코0=Anti-Shia Rhetoric
GCC_inflame_rhetoric_desc코0=Salafism is a brand of Sunni Islam that rejects deviations from the true faith. Shiism is one of the most prominent of these deviations. By favoring revivalist Salafi rhetoric that demonizes the Shia, we can convince our population of the need to persecute this subservise group.
GCC_close_shia_mosques코0=Close Shia Mosques
GCC_close_shia_mosques_desc코0=Shia mosques have become hubs of dissent towards our government, where the enemies of the state plot the downfall of [ROOT.GetLeader]. We must close down these hotbeds of terrorism to deprive these subversive elements of their main venue for plotting sedition.
GCC_comprehensive_crackdown코0=Comprehensive Crackdown
GCC_comprehensive_crackdown_desc코0=Now that we have successfully extended the control of our state over society, we have the ability to crack down on Shia terrorism wherever it may be, allowing us to crush resistance before it even has a chance to emerge. We can now officially declare an end to the Shia threat.
GCC_the_gcc코0=The Gulf Cooperation Council
GCC_the_gcc_desc코0=Formed in 1981, the GCC is one of the most prominent intergovernmental organizations in the Middle East. It seeks to bring together the majority of the Arab states of the Gulf in a political and economic union. The members of the GCC share similar forms of government and have normally adopted similar foreign policies but differing interests have so far hindered serious integration efforts.
GCC_economic_union코0=Economic Union
GCC_economic_union_desc코0=The economies of the GCC, while powerful, remain extremely disconnected. This lack of connectivity has frustrated integration in other areas.
GCC_intra_gcc_trade코0=Intra-GCC Trade
GCC_intra_gcc_trade_desc코0=Intra-GCC has so far remained limited due to the similar structures of the Gulf economies given the widespread reliance on oil. The majority of trade is instead with non-Middle Eastern countries in Europe, North America and Asia that have developed secondary and tertiary sectors. In order for the GCC to become a truly united entity, this situation has to be rectified
GCC_standardize_regulations코0=Joint Research Initiatives
GCC_standardize_regulations_desc코0=Were the Gulf states to unite our combined scientific capabilities, we would be able to boast the same innovative potential as other developing economies.
GCC_common_market코0=Common Market
GCC_common_market_desc코0=The establishment of a common market would go a long way to promote the integration of the GCC, as it would facilitate the movement of people, goods and services across borders, facilitating the creation of a shared GCC identity.
GCC_monetary_union코0=Shared Currency
GCC_monetary_union_desc코0=Forming a monetary union, the Khaleeji area, will enhance the GCC's collective impact on global financial markets and promote intra-GCC trade, but will also force member states to relinquish control over their monetary policy.
GCC_cross_border_transit_systems코0=Cross-Border Transit Systems
GCC_cross_border_transit_systems_desc코0=The lack of infrastructure such as rail networks and highways between GCC member states has hampered cross-border interactions. Investing in this infrastructure will help further the cause of GCC integration and stimulate local economies.
GCC_military_union코0=Military Union
GCC_military_union_desc코0=When Baathist Iraq made gains in the war against Iran in 1981, Saddam Hussein sought to take charge of security in the Gulf region through a united Arab force headquartered in Baghdad. The GCC was created shortly after this proposal as a way to counter Saddam's initiative and since then collective security against external threats, including Baathist Iraq, has been an important part of the GCC's remit.
GCC_joint_defense_agreement코0=Joint Defense Agreement
GCC_joint_defense_agreement_desc코0=The joint defense agreement will codify every GCC member state's commitment to the security of the entire organization. This will help secure GCC states, especially weaker members, against external enemies thereby preventing a repeat of the occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
GCC_gulf_academy코0=The Gulf Academy
GCC_gulf_academy_desc코0=Establishing the Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies will help improve and standardize the training of GCC military officers. In the event of an armed conflict involving GCC member states, the shared experience of our army officers at this institution will prove invaluable.
GCC_limited_unified_command코0=Command & Control
GCC_limited_unified_command_desc코0=While the GCC member states have all expressed commitments to the security of their fellow member states, our armed forces remain fragmented and divided. In order to maximize the ability of our armed forces to work together, we should establish a unified system of command and control to better coordinate the various GCC armies against external aggressors.
GCC_joint_military_ventures코0=GCC Joint Ventures
GCC_joint_military_ventures_desc코0=Most GCC states lack an indigenous arms industry, relying primarily on foreign arms imports. Supporting joint ventures between different GCC arms companies will help reduce this dependence.
GCC_a_robust_alliance코0=A Robust Alliance
GCC_a_robust_alliance_desc코0=Now that the GCC militaries have been sufficiently integrated, the time has come to establish a NATO-like alliance that has the capacity to act together both defensively and offensively.
GCC_political_union코0=Political Union
GCC_political_union_desc코0=One key function of the GCC has been to provide a framework for the various Gulf states to formulate a common foreign policy. However, some member states, most notably Oman and Qatar, have pursued independent foreign policies that largely do not reflect the outlooks of their fellow member states. Increasing the cohesiveness of the GCC's foreign policy will mitigate these internal differences.
GCC_solidify_pro_american_alignment코0=Solidify Pro-American Alignment
GCC_solidify_pro_american_alignment_desc코0=The GCC has historically viewed the United States as its primary external backer. We should consolidate this alliance by securing an American commitment to the defence of the entire GCC.
GCC_increase_autonomy코0=Increase Autonomy
GCC_increase_autonomy_desc코0=For too long the Gulf states have been subservient to the interests of foreign powers. Not only has this arrangement suppressed the abilities of the people of the Gulf by breeding complacency and neo-colonial dependency, but it has failed to guarantee the security of the Arab Gulf states. We stand stronger on our own.
GCC_pursue_hegemony코0=Pursue Hegemony
GCC_pursue_hegemony_desc코0=Ironically, distancing the GCC from foreign powers helps increase the autonomy of the GCC as a whole while undermining the autonomy of the smaller member states of the GCC. These smaller states are no longer able to balance against our dominance by turning to external partners, providing us with the perfect opportunity to pursue regional hegemony.
GCC_exploit_authority코0=Exploit Authority
GCC_exploit_authority_desc코0=Our influence across the Gulf has now increased to the point where there is a little that our smaller neighbors can do to counteract our demands. We should exploit our regional primacy to demand concessions from our fellow GCC member states for the good of the organization as a whole.
GCC_benign_dominance코0=Benign Dominance
GCC_benign_dominance_desc코0=It is best for us to preserve the unity of the GCC by not seeking to exploit our leverage over our fellow member states. This restraint on our part will demonstrate our willingness to see our neighbors as equals, rather than puppets.
GCC_gulf_super_state코0=The Khaleeji Union
GCC_gulf_super_state_desc코0=The time has come to unite the nation states of the Gulf that share a common history, culture, language and religion. The new state of Khaleej will be the most powerful force in the Middle East, and will earn international respect due to its economic prowess, military self-reliance and political stability.
GCC_new_partners코0=New Partners
GCC_new_partners_desc코0=The United States has shown that it is no longer a dependable guarantor of the GCC's security. We should turn instead to other allies that may not share the military expertise of the United States, but will be more willing to commit to the defence of the GCC.

GCC_GENERIC_political_reform코0=Political Reform
GCC_GENERIC_political_reform_desc코0=To prevent stagnation of our domestic political scenes, the government must keep the country and its people politically engaged and active. Legislation must be drafted, government officials appointed, funding plans passed and public projects planned. The [Root.GetAdjective] government may not become complacent in its effort to modernize and strengthen the country.
GCC_GENERIC_cabinet_reform코0=Cabinet Reform
GCC_GENERIC_cabinet_reform_desc코0=By replacing several key actors in the cabinet that are currently opposed to the head of government's agenda, the executive branch can project strength and determination in dealing with upcoming political questions and crises. In doing so, we must ignore the haters, losers and naysayers.
GCC_GENERIC_expand_the_secret_service코0=Expand the Secret Service
GCC_GENERIC_expand_the_secret_service_desc코0=The security of [Root.GetNameDef] is greatly dependent upon the strength of its military and civilian intelligence agencies. We must find effective countermeasures against hostile agents, subversive elements of society, terrorists or the (at least not impossible) potential of an enemy nuclear attack.
GCC_GENERIC_build_intelligence_stations코0=Build Intelligence Stations
GCC_GENERIC_build_intelligence_stations_desc코0=A follow-up to World War 2's RADAR stations, the Intelligence Stations will provide us with detailed reports on enemy troops movements and incoming aircraft. We will use the experiences from the espionage affairs and intrigue of the Cold War era.

GCC_GENERIC_international_diplomacy코0=International Diplomacy
GCC_GENERIC_international_diplomacy_desc코0=The art of making backroom deals, public displays of holier-than-thou attitudes and dividing small countries between their bigger neighbors, the practice of international diplomacy has a long established culture with a mixture of grandstanding and pragmatic machiavellianism. After all, the main goal of diplomacy is to secure the country's oil supply. [Root.GetNameDef] may not fall behind.
GCC_GENERIC_trade_with_the_neighbors코0=Trade with the Neighbors
GCC_GENERIC_trade_with_the_neighbors_desc코0=After closing ranks with our immediate neighbors through both expansion of our diplomatic staffs and expansion of our road network, we can now pursue a closer trade integration with our next door partners. This will help profits for both our large companies and our small businesspeople.
GCC_GENERIC_alignment_debate코0=Alignment Debate
GCC_GENERIC_alignment_debate_desc코0=An open question of international diplomacy is always the conflicting and juxtaposted ideas of neutrality and isolationism versus the idea of interventionism.
GCC_GENERIC_neutrality코0=Neutrality
GCC_GENERIC_neutrality_desc코0=We should always be concerned with the safety and prosperity of [Root.GetAdjective] citizens first and foremost. We cannot waste our young men, natural resources and financial assets in foreign entanglements.
