austrian_neutrality코0=Austrian Neutrality
austrian_neutrality_desc코0=After seeing the partition of Germany into two states in 1949, the Austrians looked to prevent a division of their own nation at all costs. When Austria was founded from the former western allied and Soviet occupation zones in 1955, Austria made a promise to both sides to neither join the western or the eastern alliance, was however soon locked on the western side of the Iron Curtain.\n\nAustria's commitment to a full neutrality has however been questioned when Austria applied to join the EU in 1989 and eventually did in 1995. Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors.
belgian_political_system코0=Political System of Belgium
belgian_political_system_desc코0=Belgium's political system is legendary for being overly complicated. The federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy of Belgium has a king as well as a central and national Belgian parliament (Brussels), a parliament for the Dutch-speaking Flemish community (Brussels), a parliament for the French-speaking Walloon community (Brussels), a parliament for the German-speaking community in the borderlands with Germany (Eupen), as well as a special designation for the officially bilingual capital city Brussels, the 'Capital Region', making Brussels the seat of three parliaments, but putting it ever so slightly out of the jurisdiction of the two regional ones and, of course, under the jurisdiction of its own Brussels parliament.\nAdd to that the subdivision into 10 provinces (not in Brussels though), 43 arrodissements and 589 municipalities and you have a thoroughly complicated and overly inefficient political system - that however succeeds in representing every single citizen sufficiently and thoroughly. Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe.

However, on Sepetember of 1999 the heads of state called for an AFrican Union which would promote unity and growth across all of Africa, thus the African Union as we know it was born.
