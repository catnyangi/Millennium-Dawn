GRE_merge_def코0=Merge Defense Industries
GRE_merge_def_desc코0=Merging certain defense industries can at the very least decrease the bloated bureaucracy present when dealing with multiple small industries, as opposed to one big one. Additionally, these industries produce the same products, and the process would become more seamless and efficient if cooperation was increased where it wasn't already present.
GRE_subsidize_eas코0=Subsidize EAS
GRE_subsidize_eas_desc코0=EAS (Hellenic Defense Systems) is the main Greek producer of weapons for our military, but it is, however, facing severe economic problems; therefore, we will need to financially support EAS in order to keep one of our main weapon producers supporting our military.

greece.16.t코0=A Cracked Foundation
greece.16.d코0=It gets harder and harder to sleep every night, as the country falls to pieces. The northernmost cities are experiencing organized attacks that have resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides.

greece.18.t코0=Greece Bids Away Piraeus
greece.18.d코0=Port Piraeus has recently been bid away by the Greek government in an attempt to procure funds for the debt crisis.
