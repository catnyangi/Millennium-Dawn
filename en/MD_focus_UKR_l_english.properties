###Revolution Events
ukraine_revolution.0.t코0=New Mechanics for Ukraine
ukraine_revolution.0.d코0=Ukraine is an intersting country to play as in the timeline of Millennium Dawn. However, there are some important notes to consider when playing through the tree.\n\nThere are two main variables/counters that are extremely important to Ukraine:Stability of Regime (SOR for short) and Chance of Revolt (COR for short).\n\n Stability of Regime (SOR) is different from the normal stability at the top of the screen. It is entirely unique to Ukraine and is meant to mock the progression over the next 5-10 years transition towards the eventual war in the Donbas. Most effects in the focus tree and events in general will make use of this new mechanic in the effort to integrate decisions much heavier into the tree and the players playstyle. You can use this as a style of 'currency' in the fashion you can utilize it to lower the Chance of Revolt counter.\n\nChance of Revolt on the otherhand displays just that. Once you reach 15 a mission will trigger that can cause the war in the Donbas. It is important to attempt to maintain this variable as much as you can or else you may have a civil war on your hands.\n\nYou can always retrigger this event in the Stability of Ukraine decisions.\n
