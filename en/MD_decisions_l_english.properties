### Help events ###
help_events.0.t코0=Economics
help_events.0.d코0=In MD4, your factories represent the GDP of your country. This is the total amount of value of all goods produced in your country.\n\nPart of your factories are used up by your government to fund the basic functions of the government. This is called Tax Cost (Consumer Goods in the base game). The higher your Tax Cost, the less factories you have available for investing in your economy (ie. constructing new factories).
help_events.0.a코0=To Economic Indicators
help_events.1.t코0=Economic Indicators
help_events.1.d코0=Your economic indicators can be found on the politics screen. The richness of your country is measured by your GDP/C (GDP per capita). The higher the value, the richer your population is. Increasing your GDP/C will grant you more building slots in your states, and give you access to more research slots (see 'Research' help). You can increase your GDP/C by filling your building slots. Once you have no more empty slots, you will be able to advance to the next GDP/C level, which will give you more slots, which you fill and so forth.\n\nYour Economic Cycle dictates the speed at which your economy is growing (construction speed). Having a fast growing economy will also make your government more popular. Economic Cycles can be affected by events, and it can be increased by spending Political Power.
help_events.1.a코0=To Government Budget
help_events.2.t코0=Government Budget
help_events.2.d코0=Your Government Budget can be found on the politics screen as well. Your budget dictates how much your government spends on various governmental functions, such as defence. Spending more will give you various bonuses but will increase your Tax Cost. This will then make it harder for you to expand your economy. You can offset some of this spending by loaning money by having a negative budget balance.\n\nLoaning money will slowly increase your national debt, which will increase your Tax Cost in the long run as you have to pay interest. You can also have a positive budget balance, which will slowly pay off your debt and increase your monetary reserves. On the long run, this will give you reduced Tax Cost since you can use some of your reserves to fund your budget.
help_events.2.a코0=Thanks for the info!
help_events.3.a코0=Thanks for the info!
help_events.3.t코0=Units
help_events.3.d코0=In MD4, all of your units start at 0 strength. This done so that we can then add correct real life equipment to units through the stockpile. Due to this, you should avoid training new units for the first week or so in order not to rob equipment from your existing units. Don't be scared by the large number of equipment there are available. Most basic infantry units can be deployed with just small arms. Obviously, not having AA or AT equipment will impact your units' ability to fight against aircraft or armoured vehicles. When playing as smaller countries, you'll have to rotate your production lines to get all the equipment you need.\n\nThe most effective way of gaining more manpower is by increasing your military spending.

TUR_SYR코0=Syrian Civil War
TUR_SYR_desc코0=The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing multi-sided armed conflict in Syria fought primarily between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, along with its allies, and various forces opposing the government. The unrest in Syria, part of a wider wave of 2011 Arab Spring protests, grew out of discontent with the Assad government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for his removal were violently suppressed.

tur_intervene_SYR_desc코0=Historically Turkey has backed the Free Syrian Army

TUR_afrin코0=Announce Anti-Kurdish Operations in Syria
TUR_afrin_desc코0=Kurdish terrorists go by many names, but that does not mean they do not share the same ideals as each other. The PKK has always been a threat to Turkey and it will remain a threat until it along with it's allies in the YPG, PYD, SDF, et cetera, are destroyed. It starts with Afrin, gather the troops.
TUR_afrin2코0=Launch Operation Olive Branch
TUR_afrin2_desc코0=If the Kurds cannot learn to accept their failure and defeat, they will continue to attack Turkey and it's people, and this is where we must draw the line. Olive Branch will put an end to Kurdish terror attacks originating from the YPG held territory of Afrin. The operation is determined to root out and destroy Kurdish terrorists without collateral damage, we must proceed carefully.

TUR_afrin_d코0=Turkish Forces Threaten Afrin
TUR_afrin_d_desc코0=The Turkish onslaught of Kurdish people continues. The threat of an invasion of Afrin is real, as the Turkish president [their_country.GetLeader], unsurprisingly branded us as terrorists aligned with the PKK and threatened to strangle us before we could attack Turkish land in a ridiculous terror attack. This is not our way, but we must prepare for an attack immediately!
TUR_afrin_d2코0=Turkish Forces Continue to Advance
TUR_afrin_d2_desc코0=They call it \"Operation Olive Branch\", funny how the saying goes that the olive branch is in offer of peace. The Turks no not the meaning of peace, and their campaign of Kurdish oppression continues against the wrong opponent. Alas, if they want to continue this fight, we shall continue to defend ourselves.

TUR_counter_terrorism_mil코0=Counter Terror Operations - Military Branch

strenghten_outposts_1코0=Strengthen Outposts
strenghten_outposts_1_desc코0=Our outposts in the south-eastern part of our country has built up to stop smuggling from and to Northern Iraq around 1960s. Now, facing terror attacks, they are either too old or at the wrong positions and highly vulnerable to asymmetrical attacks. We need to come up with a solution to this, it may cost a lot of money but will make it up to us with the lives saved. And opposition will surely try and discredit this reform as they always do, saying it will waste our money for no benefit, so there is little room for failure.
strenghten_outposts_2코0=Starting up on Strong Outposts
strenghten_outposts_2_desc코0=First of our new outposts should prove their effectiveness in short notice, due to political reasons. Maybe build them on high, overlooking points and preferably around narrow points that terrorists have been using to infiltrate.
strenghten_outposts_3코0=Critical positions first
strenghten_outposts_3_desc코0=Some of our outposts like Aktütün Karakolu are notorious for being raided on a regular basis because of strategic reasons. We should improve these weak positions first and terrorists will have to make new plans.
strenghten_outposts_4코0=Further Improvements
strenghten_outposts_4_desc코0=New outposts prove to be enough at repelling terrorist attacks or not getting attacked in the first place, now terrorists are avoiding the strong ones and focusing on the old, weaker ones. Maybe we should dismantle the unnecessary ones and build brand new outposts on the needed positions
strenghten_outposts_5코0=Strategic Brilliance
strenghten_outposts_5_desc코0=Attacks on our outposts have been fairly reduced, maybe we can think about building new dams that will hinder terrorists routes with their lakes, and use these dams as fortified bridges

internal_security_desc코0=Eastern part of our country has a rough terrain, it holds many deserted villages, castle-like natural valleys filled with caves, narrow passages around mountains that no one lives.

external_security_desc코0=PKK does not only exist inside our borders, a good portion of their members has bases in Northern Iraq too, to take advantage of the same rough terrain, be somewhat more secure from our military might, control smuggling and for recruitment.

college_professors_desc코0=We have a fight at our hands and these people that are supposed to be enlightened, but they bitch about the situation and want the government to abdicate whenever a terrorist attack happens and call it genocide or xenophobia whenever we try to make a move against PKK. This needs to be stopped. We will either purge them or make sure they won't discredit our actions with baseless claims anymore
kurdish_language_1코0=Kurdish language problem
kurdish_language_1_desc코0=For years there was a unwritten rule against Kurdish language. Not only opening television channels and universities with Kurdish language is banned, even if you are telling something Kurdish in public or in a street you might get attacked verbally.

kurdish_language_4코0=Kurdish TV Channels
kurdish_language_4_desc코0=We will allow people to open Kurdish channels, not only this will discredit PKK's propaganda about Kurds being oppressed, it will win hearts of adult people who born Kurdish and never got the chance to learn Turkish. Although we need to hire people to keep an eye on these channels and prevent them being used for PKK propaganda.\n\nUnlocks the fifth decision for more reforms.
kurdish_language_5코0=Kurdish State Channel
kurdish_language_5_desc코0=TRT (short for Türkiye Radyo Televizyon, Turkish Radio and Television) has been our official state TV since '68. By years, it numbers grew up and there are now several channels of TRT, some of them are for general subjects or for example TRT-Müzik broadcasts only music or TRT-Belgesel broadcasts only documentaries. We should open up a new one that will operate in Kurdish language. This can cost more but will further discredit PKK propaganda.

###Burma
ethnic_insurgency_category코0=The Internal Conflict in Myanmar
ethnic_insurgency_category_desc코0=The past few decades have been marked by successive ceasefires between the Burmese government and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). These ceasefires have been punctuated by violent clashes between the Tatmadaw and EAOs, clashes which have often, but not always, resulted in nothing more than a return to the status quo. The balance between peace and war is a delicate one, and it is one that both sides must handle carefully.\n\nThe level of influence Myanmar has in any particular EAO determines whether Myanmar can annex the rebel territory or whether the breakaway state can declare independence. Ceasefires will allow Myanmar to accumulate influence in EAOs slowly over an extended period of time.

attack_drug_factories_desc코0=The United Wa State Army is heavily involved in the illegal production of drugs like heroin and \"ya ba\", a meth tablet. Attacking and destroying these factories will require effort and resources, but it will help our international legitimacy and with it, our cause. However, we must be prepared for the Wa to retaliate against us.
intercept_drug_convoys코0=Intercept Wa Drug Convoys
intercept_drug_convoys_desc코0=Our position on the Thai border means we can intercept drugs being transferred from Wa territory to Thailand. Confiscating these drugs and burning them in front of Thai and international news organisations will increase international opinion of our group but may prompt a military response from the United Wa State Army.

end_opium_production_desc코0=The United States has labelled our organisation as a narcotics trafficker and has issued arrest warrants for some of our top commanders.

end_meth_production코0=End \"Ya Ba\" Production
end_meth_production_desc코0=Ya ba is a methamphetamine tablet that is a major source of funding for us and helps support our economy. However, it makes it difficult for us to shake off our negative reputation, particularly in relation to Thailand where ya ba has become widespread.

BRM_remove_state_religion코0=Return to Having no State Religion

show_countries_that_recognize_the_ROC_desc코0=While most countries have switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC decades ago, a number of them have not. This number is steadily dwindling due to the PRC's charm offensive, wooing these remaining supporters of the ROC with political and economic benefits. The ROC, for its part, has been largely unable to stop this from happening. Recognition is determined by a number of factors including influence, opinion, outlook and form of government.
declare_independence_taiwan코0=Declare Independence

This means that it is neither a part of the People's Republic as the CCP claims, nor is it the temporary stronghold of the government of the Republic of China, as the KMT and their allies claim.
