### Help events ###
help_events.0.t코0=Economics
help_events.0.d코0=In MD4, your factories represent the GDP of your country. This is the total amount of value of all goods produced in your country.\n\nPart of your factories are used up by your government to fund the basic functions of the government. This is called Tax Cost (Consumer Goods in the base game). The higher your Tax Cost, the less factories you have available for investing in your economy (ie. constructing new factories).
help_events.0.a코0=To Economic Indicators
help_events.1.t코0=Economic Indicators
help_events.1.d코0=Your economic indicators can be found on the politics screen. The richness of your country is measured by your GDP/C (GDP per capita). The higher the value, the richer your population is. Increasing your GDP/C will grant you more building slots in your states, and give you access to more research slots (see 'Research' help). You can increase your GDP/C by filling your building slots. Once you have no more empty slots, you will be able to advance to the next GDP/C level, which will give you more slots, which you fill and so forth.\n\nYour Economic Cycle dictates the speed at which your economy is growing (construction speed). Having a fast growing economy will also make your government more popular. Economic Cycles can be affected by events, and it can be increased by spending Political Power.
help_events.1.a코0=To Government Budget
help_events.2.t코0=Government Budget
help_events.2.d코0=Your Government Budget can be found on the politics screen as well. Your budget dictates how much your government spends on various governmental functions, such as defence. Spending more will give you various bonuses but will increase your Tax Cost. This will then make it harder for you to expand your economy. You can offset some of this spending by loaning money by having a negative budget balance.\n\nLoaning money will slowly increase your national debt, which will increase your Tax Cost in the long run as you have to pay interest. You can also have a positive budget balance, which will slowly pay off your debt and increase your monetary reserves. On the long run, this will give you reduced Tax Cost since you can use some of your reserves to fund your budget.
help_events.2.a코0=Thanks for the info!
help_events.3.a코0=Thanks for the info!
help_events.3.t코0=Units
help_events.3.d코0=In MD4, all of your units start at 0 strength. This done so that we can then add correct real life equipment to units through the stockpile. Due to this, you should avoid training new units for the first week or so in order not to rob equipment from your existing units. Don't be scared by the large number of equipment there are available. Most basic infantry units can be deployed with just small arms. Obviously, not having AA or AT equipment will impact your units' ability to fight against aircraft or armoured vehicles. When playing as smaller countries, you'll have to rotate your production lines to get all the equipment you need.\n\nThe most effective way of gaining more manpower is by increasing your military spending.

##### Influence Desicions #####

influence_desicions코0=[Root.GetAdjective] [GetYear] Report on Foreign Influence
influence_desicions_desc코0=The Intelligence Services of [Root.GetNameDef] have prepared a report on the influence foreign governments wield upon our nation. For the sake of our sovereignty, we must seek to limit this influence. If a single nation dominates us, they may seek to interfere in the government and our way of life.\n\n§HThe following nations hold influence over us:0§!\n[new_position_1] [position_1_var] [position_1_var_integer]   [new_position_2] [position_2_var] [position_2_var_integer]   [new_position_3] [position_3_var] [position_3_var_integer]   [new_position_4] [position_4_var] [position_4_var_integer]   [new_position_5] [position_5_var] [position_5_var_integer]   [new_position_6] [position_6_var] [position_6_var_integer]   [new_position_7] [position_7_var] [position_7_var_integer]\n\nThis gives us a level of independence from foreign influence of [?domestic_influence_amount_calc|%H0] ([?domestic_influence_amount]).

GER_nationalist_claims_AUS코0=Claim rightful territory:0 [AUS.GetNameWithFlag]

TUR_SYR코0=Syrian Civil War
TUR_SYR_desc코0=The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing multi-sided armed conflict in Syria fought primarily between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, along with its allies, and various forces opposing the government. The unrest in Syria, part of a wider wave of 2011 Arab Spring protests, grew out of discontent with the Assad government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for his removal were violently suppressed.

TUR_afrin코0=Announce Anti-Kurdish Operations in Syria
TUR_afrin_desc코0=Kurdish terrorists go by many names, but that does not mean they do not share the same ideals as each other. The PKK has always been a threat to Turkey and it will remain a threat until it along with it's allies in the YPG, PYD, SDF, et cetera, are destroyed. It starts with Afrin, gather the troops.
TUR_afrin2코0=Launch Operation Olive Branch
TUR_afrin2_desc코0=If the Kurds cannot learn to accept their failure and defeat, they will continue to attack Turkey and it's people, and this is where we must draw the line. Olive Branch will put an end to Kurdish terror attacks originating from the YPG held territory of Afrin. The operation is determined to root out and destroy Kurdish terrorists without collateral damage, we must proceed carefully.

TUR_afrin_d코0=Turkish Forces Threaten Afrin
TUR_afrin_d_desc코0=The Turkish onslaught of Kurdish people continues. The threat of an invasion of Afrin is real, as the Turkish president [their_country.GetLeader], unsurprisingly branded us as terrorists aligned with the PKK and threatened to strangle us before we could attack Turkish land in a ridiculous terror attack. This is not our way, but we must prepare for an attack immediately!
TUR_afrin_d2코0=Turkish Forces Continue to Advance
TUR_afrin_d2_desc코0=They call it "Operation Olive Branch", funny how the saying goes that the olive branch is in offer of peace. The Turks no not the meaning of peace, and their campaign of Kurdish oppression continues against the wrong opponent. Alas, if they want to continue this fight, we shall continue to defend ourselves.

TUR_counter_terrorism_mil코0=Counter Terror Operations - Military Branch
TUR_counter_terrorism_mil_desc코0=Decisions related to anti-terrorism actions.

strenghten_outposts_1코0=Strengthen Outposts
strenghten_outposts_1_desc코0=Our outposts in the south-eastern part of our country has built up to stop smuggling from and to Northern Iraq around 1960s. Now, facing terror attacks, they are either too old or at the wrong positions and highly vulnerable to asymmetrical attacks. We need to come up with a solution to this, it may cost a lot of money but will make it up to us with the lives saved. And opposition will surely try and discredit this reform as they always do, saying it will waste our money for no benefit, so there is little room for failure.
strenghten_outposts_2코0=Starting up on Strong Outposts
strenghten_outposts_2_desc코0=First of our new outposts should prove their effectiveness in short notice, due to political reasons. Maybe build them on high, overlooking points and preferably around narrow points that terrorists have been using to infiltrate.
strenghten_outposts_3코0=Critical positions first
strenghten_outposts_3_desc코0=Some of our outposts like Aktütün Karakolu are notorious for being raided on a regular basis because of strategic reasons. We should improve these weak positions first and terrorists will have to make new plans.
strenghten_outposts_4코0=Further Improvements
strenghten_outposts_4_desc코0=New outposts prove to be enough at repelling terrorist attacks or not getting attacked in the first place, now terrorists are avoiding the strong ones and focusing on the old, weaker ones. Maybe we should dismantle the unnecessary ones and build brand new outposts on the needed positions
strenghten_outposts_5코0=Strategic Brilliance
strenghten_outposts_5_desc코0=Attacks on our outposts have been fairly reduced, maybe we can think about building new dams that will hinder terrorists routes with their lakes, and use these dams as fortified bridges
strenghten_outposts_6코0=Success loves preparation
strenghten_outposts_6_desc코0=Nearly every outpost of us either rebuilt or left and razed. Only some final stages needed to polish up some sharp edges and we are done.

afg_integrate_pashtunistan_desc코0=Even though the Pashtuns share Afghanistan's dominant ethnicity, many Pashtuns in the new areas still resent our government. We need to spend resources to convince them that they are better off with us.

integration_raetia_noricum_desc코01=The lands beyond the Alps has always been a bit of the wildland. The mountain boys in Switzerland and Austria will fall in line one by one. Their lands were some of the first conquered areas due to their proximity to the northern regions of the empire.

integration_cyrenaica_aegyptus_desc코0=Egypt and Northeastern Libya were once a cornerstone of our empire. They were able to feed significant portions of the empire with the fertile lands in the Nile, while also providing important docks for us in the deltas. We must start to Romanize the people there again to breathe more life into Rome.
integration_anatolia코0=Romanize Anatolia

###Burma
ethnic_insurgency_category코0=The Internal Conflict in Myanmar
ethnic_insurgency_category_desc코0=The past few decades have been marked by successive ceasefires between the Burmese government and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). These ceasefires have been punctuated by violent clashes between the Tatmadaw and EAOs, clashes which have often, but not always, resulted in nothing more than a return to the status quo. The balance between peace and war is a delicate one, and it is one that both sides must handle carefully.\n\nThe level of influence Myanmar has in any particular EAO determines whether Myanmar can annex the rebel territory or whether the breakaway state can declare independence. Ceasefires will allow Myanmar to accumulate influence in EAOs slowly over an extended period of time. Military operations give Myanmar significant influence in targeted EAOs if successful, but will give the EAOs much greater independence from Burmese influence if they fail.\n\n[BRM.GetFlag] [BRM.GetAdjective] influence in EAOs:0 [KAC.GetNamewithFlag] [KAC.BRM_influence_KAC_var] [KAC.BRM_influence_KAC_var_integer] [KAR.GetNamewithFlag] [KAR.BRM_influence_KAR_var] [KAR.BRM_influence_KAR_var_integer] [SHN.GetNamewithFlag] [SHN.BRM_influence_SHN_var] [SHN.BRM_influence_SHN_var_integer] [WAA.GetNamewithFlag] [WAA.BRM_influence_WAA_var] [WAA.BRM_influence_WAA_var_integer]

BRM_propose_the_NCA_desc코0=The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement is an ambitious attempt to reach a lasting peace with 15 of Myanmar's most powerful EAOs. We should try to secure bilateral ceasefires with each individual EAO before attempting this.
BRM_renegotiate_the_NCA코0=Renegotiate the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
BRM_renegotiate_the_NCA_desc코0=The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement is an ambitious attempt to reach a lasting peace with 15 of Myanmar's most powerful EAOs. However, the current text is not perfect and can be improved. We should try to secure bilateral ceasefires with each individual EAO before attempting this.
BRM_scrap_the_NCA코0=Scrap the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
BRM_scrap_the_NCA_desc코0=
BRM_ceasefire_KAC코0=Propose a Ceasefire with the Kachin
BRM_ceasefire_KAC_desc코0=The conflict between us and the Kachin Independence Army has gone on for too long. A ceasefire will allow us to regain our strength and increase our influence over Kachin state. Whether the rebels accept our offer is determined by our relations with them and our current form of government. After we make a ceasefire offer we will not be able to make a new one for 30 days.
BRM_ceasefire_KAR코0=Propose a Ceasefire with the Karen
BRM_ceasefire_KAR_desc코0=The conflict between us and the Karen National Liberation Army has gone on for too long. A ceasefire will allow us to regain our strength and increase our influence over Karen state. Whether the rebels accept our offer is determined by our relations with them and our current form of government. After we make a ceasefire offer we will not be able to make a new one for 30 days.
BRM_ceasefire_SHN코0=Propose a Ceasefire with the Shan
BRM_ceasefire_SHN_desc코0=The conflict between us and the Shan State Army has gone on for too long. A ceasefire will allow us to regain our strength and increase our influence over Shan state. Whether the rebels accept our offer is determined by our relations with them and our current form of government. After we make a ceasefire offer we will not be able to make a new one for 30 days.
BRM_provoke_KAC코0=Provoke an Incident in Kachin Ceasefire Zones
BRM_provoke_KAC_desc코0=Peace with the Kachin is not serving our interests. We can bring about a return to active operations against the Kachin Independence Army by provoking a confrontation between our forces and theirs.
BRM_provoke_KAR코0=Provoke an Incident in Karen Ceasefire Zones
BRM_provoke_KAR_desc코0=Peace with the Karen is not serving our interests. We can bring about a return to active operations against the Karen National Liberation Army by provoking a confrontation between our forces and theirs.
BRM_provoke_SHN코0=Provoke an Incident in Shan Ceasefire Zones

attack_drug_factories코0=Attack Wa Drug Factories
attack_drug_factories_desc코0=The United Wa State Army is heavily involved in the illegal production of drugs like heroin and "ya ba", a meth tablet. Attacking and destroying these factories will require effort and resources, but it will help our international legitimacy and with it, our cause. However, we must be prepared for the Wa to retaliate against us.
intercept_drug_convoys코0=Intercept Wa Drug Convoys
intercept_drug_convoys_desc코0=Our position on the Thai border means we can intercept drugs being transferred from Wa territory to Thailand. Confiscating these drugs and burning them in front of Thai and international news organisations will increase international opinion of our group but may prompt a military response from the United Wa State Army.
end_opium_production코0=End Heroin Production
end_opium_production_desc코0=The United States has labelled our organisation as a narcotics trafficker and has issued arrest warrants for some of our top commanders. More importantly, China also disapproves of our involvement in the heroin trade and so, while it may hurt our economy, it may be in our best interests to ban cultivation of opium poppies and end heroin production.
end_meth_production코0=End "Ya Ba" Production
end_meth_production_desc코0=Ya ba is a methamphetamine tablet that is a major source of funding for us and helps support our economy. However, it makes it difficult for us to shake off our negative reputation, particularly in relation to Thailand where ya ba has become widespread. We may have to accept the short-term economic shocks from ending ya ba production if we want to be viewed positively by the international community.
attack_tatmadaw코0=Attack the Tatmadaw
attack_tatmadaw_desc코0=The central government does not seem to want to leave us in peace. In order to ensure the safety of our people we must strike at the hated Tatmadaw before they can come into our own homes.

BRM_sangha_category코0=Buddhism Policy
BRM_sangha_category_desc코0=In order to keep the opinion of the country's Buddhist monks, also known as the sangha, favourable to the government, we must ensure that Buddhist institutions in Myanmar have sufficient funding. However, the sangha may refuse to accept our patronage, a possibility that increases the lower their opinion of us is.
BRM_impose_state_religion코0=Make Buddhism our State Religion
BRM_impose_state_religion_desc코0=Since 90% of the nation is Buddhist by faith, it is only natural for us to make that religious reality a political one too. This move may antagonise our religious minorities, but it will win us the support of the sangha.
BRM_remove_state_religion코0=Return to Having no State Religion
BRM_remove_state_religion_desc코0=We must accept that imposing a state religion has not been to our advantage. The antagonisation of various minorities has far outstripped the benefits from the increased support of a few Buddhist nationalists.
BRM_minor_funding코0=Minor Funding for Buddhist Institutions
BRM_minor_funding_desc코0=We cannot afford to give more than a small amount to support Buddhism in Myanmar. This has a low chance of increasing the sangha's opinion of us.

BRM_no_influence코0=0%

BRM_Administrative_Decisions코0=Administrative Decisions
BRM_Administrative_Decisions_desc코0=Our military strategists have concluded that having Yangon as a capital leaves us vulnerable to the possibility of an amphibious invasion. Relocating the capital to a more remote location would, in the event of a war with a stronger foreign power, allow the Tatmadaw to organize guerrilla warfare from a secure command post.
BRM_plans_for_new_capital코0=Draw Up Plans for a New Capital
BRM_begin_construction_capital코0=Begin Construction of Naypyidaw

###China
one_china_category코0=Cross-Strait Relations
one_china_category_desc코0=The Chinese Civil War ended with 2 alternative governments claiming to lead the entirety of the Chinese nation, the PRC based in Beijing and the ROC headquartered in Taipei. While in 1992 both governments set aside the issue, agreeing that there was only one China but disagreeing on who was the rightful ruler of it, pro-independence figures in Taiwan have criticized this consensus and called for the establishment of an independent nation of Taiwan.\n\nThe relative popularity of the pro-reunification §CPan-Blue Coalition§! and the pro-independence §GPan-Green Coalition§! in Taiwan serves as a rough approximation of opposition to and support for independence respectively.\n\n§CPan-Blue Coalition Support§!\n£TAI_conservatism  Kuomintang:0 §Y[?TAI.party_pop_array^1|%1]§!\n£TAI_communism_Conservative  New Party:0 §Y[?TAI.party_pop_array^6|%1]§!\n£TAI_Neutral_conservatism  People First Party:0 §Y[?TAI.party_pop_array^14|%1]§!\n\nTotal Support:0 §Y[?TAI.pan_blue_coalition_support|%1]§!\n\n§GPan-Green Coalition Support§!\n£TAI_liberalism  Democratic Progressive Party:0 §Y[?TAI.party_pop_array^2|%1]§!\n£TAI_neutral_Social  Taiwan Independence Party:0 §Y[?TAI.party_pop_array^18|%1]§!\n\nTotal Support:0 §Y[?TAI.pan_green_coalition_support|%1]§!

anti_DPP_media_campaign코0=Anti-DPP Media Campaign
anti_DPP_media_campaign_desc코0=The Democratic Progress Party of Taiwan has been pushing the agenda of independence for a while now. In order to reduce their performance in Taiwanese elections, we should use our influence over Taiwanese media to portray the DPP unfavourably with respect to the pro-Chinese KMT.
anti_DPP_media_campaign_2코0=Anti-DPP Media Campaign
anti_DPP_media_campaign_2_desc코0=The Democratic Progress Party of Taiwan has been pushing the agenda of independence for a while now. In order to reduce their performance in Taiwanese elections, we should use our influence over Taiwanese media to portray the DPP unfavourably with respect to the pro-Chinese KMT.
ban_solo_travel_to_taiwan코0=Ban Solo Travel to Taiwan
ban_solo_travel_to_taiwan_desc코0=The Taiwanese economy depends on large part upon tourism from the mainland. If we were to restrict tourism to Taiwan, this would cause substantial damage to their economy and effectively demonstrate our dissatisfaction with Taiwan's behaviour.
rescind_travel_ban코0=Rescind the Travel Ban
bribe_military_officials코0=Bribe Military Officials

fortify_kinmen코0=Fortify Kinmen
fortify_kinmen_desc코0=During the Cold War the KMT built up Kinmen to serve as an anti-communist island fortress. Since the 90s however, the Taiwanese administration has largely repurposed the island to fill the purpose of popular tourist destination. Despite this recent trend, the Taiwanese authorities remain ready to ready Kinmen once again for war if the need arises.
anti_infiltration_bill코0=Pass the Anti-Infiltration Bill
anti_infiltration_bill_desc코0=China is not above using hybrid warfare to influence our democracy to favor pro-China forces. We should do what we can to limit China's ability to do this.
show_countries_that_recognize_the_ROC코0=Show Countries that have Recognized the ROC
show_countries_that_recognize_the_ROC_desc코0=While most countries have switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC decades ago, a number of them have not. This number is steadily dwindling due to the PRC's charm offensive, wooing these remaining supporters of the ROC with political and economic benefits. The ROC, for its part, has been largely unable to stop this from happening. Recognition is determined by a number of factors including influence, opinion, outlook and form of government.
declare_independence_taiwan코0=Declare Independence
declare_independence_taiwan_desc코0=Taiwan is not China. This means that it is neither a part of the People's Republic as the CCP claims, nor is it the temporary stronghold of the government of the Republic of China, as the KMT and their allies claim. As such, we should declare our independence and seek to garner international support for our status as the world's newest nation.
recalculate_coalition_support_taiwan코0=Update Total Support Values

xinjiang_category코0=Xinjiang
xinjiang_category_desc코0=The Uighur minority of Xinjiang has, for a long time, been viewed by the Chinese authorities with suspicion. This suspicion has only hardened as Uighur militant activity has grown as a result of dissatisfaction with Chinese rule. This militant threat cannot be ignored, however we must balance the need to fight terrorism with the need to win over the hearts and minds of the local people.\n§YUighur Threat§! denotes the strength of Uighur militancy, with a higher threat level leading to more deadly and destructive attacks. §YUighur Opinion§! determines the rate at which §YUighur Threat§! increases, with 100% representing overwhelming Uighur support of the government and 0% representing universal hostility.\n\n§YUighur Threat§!:0 [?ROOT.uighur_threat]%\n§YUighur Opinion§!:0 [?ROOT.uighur_opinion]%

taiwan_coup_category코0=Taiwanese Coup
taiwan_coup_category_desc코0=A secretive Taiwanese faction has started taking control of key government and military buildings all across Taiwan. To combat this unexpected threat, [TAI.GetLeader] needs to rally both civilian and military support around the government, possibly with assistance from some key allies.
rally_support_taiwan코0=Rally Civilian Support Against the Coup
rally_support_taiwan_desc코0=As a democracy, our government has always relied on the support of the people. We must rally this support if our government is to survive.
send_civilian_support_taiwan코0=Send Civilian Support to Taiwan
send_civilian_support_taiwan_desc코0=Our support will help [TAI.GetLeader] stand against the coup-plotters.
