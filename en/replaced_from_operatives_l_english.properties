upgrade_airforce_department_desc코0=§WThe Department of Aerial Intelligence will be a useful branch of our agency; responsible for infiltrating the enemy airforce and gathering intel on enemy aircraft movements.§!
upgrade_passive_defense코0=Counter-Intelligence
upgrade_passive_defense_desc코0=§WForeign agents operating on our territory pose a severe national security risk. We must invest in our counter-intelligence capabilities so as to minimize the threat that these agents pose to our country.§!
upgrade_anti_partisan코0=Counter-Insurgency
upgrade_anti_partisan_desc코0=§WThe 21st century has seen a dramatic rise in the prevalence of asymmetric warfare against non-state groups. It would be unwise to neglect these "new wars" in the training programs of our operatives.§!
upgrade_blueprint_stealing코0=Industrial Espionage
upgrade_blueprint_stealing_desc코0=§WWe know that our enemy has secret projects for experimental weapons and vehicles, what we do not know is exactly what those projects are and what they are building. By hacking the experimental weapons departments of our enemies, we will not only gain the opportunity to learn precisely what they plan to use against us, we will also be given the unique opportunity to use this information to advance our own weapons department.§!
upgrade_portable_radios코0=Secured Communication
upgrade_portable_radios_desc코0=§WWhen our agents are in the field. it is absolutely essential that they are able to communicate without the fear of being compromised by the enemy. Secure channels of communication are the key to protecting the identities and lives of our operatives.§!
upgrade_invisible_ink코0=Hidden Listening Devices
upgrade_invisible_ink_desc코0=§WWiretaps are an important tool of the modern operative, allowing him or her to listen in to conversations of a private nature. Developing bugs that can be planted in key locations will significantly improve our intelligence-gathering capabilities.§!
upgrade_plastic_explosives코0=Improvised Explosive Devices
upgrade_plastic_explosives_desc코0=§WIEDs have become an indispensable weapon for non-state armed groups all over the world. Despite their simple construction, they are capable of massive destructive potential. As such, IEDs help to even the odds between disorganized groups of insurgents and professional militaries with armored vehicles. While the insurgents that we support overseas will undoubtedly be able to manufacture IEDs themselves, we can provide them with more sophisticated technology so as to maximize the destructiveness and reliability of their devices. In this way we, can strike a blow against our foreign enemies while maintaining plausible deniability.§!
upgrade_suicide_pills코0=Suicide pills
upgrade_suicide_pills_desc코0=§WWhile undesirable, it is inevitable that a handful of agents will be captured by our enemy. We must offer our agents a way to evade the horror that awaits them in the interrogation room, and a cyanide pill in place of a tooth will provide them with that escape, should it ever comes to that.§!
upgrade_training_centers코0=Overseas Recruitment Centers
upgrade_training_centers_desc코0=§WWhile our agents are able to adapt to any environment, the cultural norms and languages of foreign lands come more naturally to those born and raised in the culture. If we are to build a worldwide network of spies, we must expand our recruitment and training centres all across the globe and recruit agents of all cultures and backgrounds.§!
upgrade_commando_training코0=Black Operations
upgrade_commando_training_desc코0=§WSome of the tasks that our intelligence agency will be forced to perform require the utmost secrecy. These special activities demand the training of operatives, recruited from our country's special forces, who can perfrom paramilitary activities in dangerous conditions. It is not enough for these operatives to be willing to die for their country. They must also be willing to be abandoned by their country and publicly renounced should they fail in their mission.§!
upgrade_interrogation_techniques코0=Interrogation Techniques
upgrade_interrogation_techniques_desc코0=§WOften it can be more effective to break an enemy agent's mind rather than their body. The use of physical force is unreliable and often results in false information; a truly skilled interrogator is capable of breaking the enemy's will without violence. But, if it comes to that, we have ways of making them talk...§!
upgrade_diplo_training코0=Diplomatic Training
upgrade_diplo_training_desc코0=§WTraining our agents to grease the palm of a few foreign investors and diplomats may convince them of the benevolence of our cause and steer their interests away from enemies of the state.§!
upgrade_psycho_warfare코0=Psychological Warfare
upgrade_psycho_warfare_desc코0=§WPropaganda has been an effective tool in securing our ideological interests within our own state, but no tool has been quite as effective as spreading fear of the enemy regimes and what they may bring to the country. By allying our agents with anti-ideological movements within foreign nations, we shall become far more effective in spreading our ideology worldwide...§!
upgrade_form_department코0=Establish Cybersecurity Division
upgrade_form_department_desc코0=§WCybersecurity is the defense of our networking from cyberwarfare. Establishing a cybersecurity division will help us better gear our intelligence agency towards this modern form of intelligence gathering.§!
upgrade_decryption_boost코0=Cyberwarfare
upgrade_decryption_boost_desc코0=§WCyberwarfare is the use of technology to attack a foreign nation. Cyber attacks can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from unsophisticated but effective direct denial-of-service attacks to the uploading of sophisticated malware programs. It is increasingly the case that a modern nation must be able to carry itself offensively on land, sea, air, and in cyber space, or risk falling behind.§!
upgrade_decryption_boost_2코0=Machine-Assisted Decryption
upgrade_decryption_boost_2_desc코0=§WMachines have proven useful in encrypting data already, with machine-assisted encrypted signals proving the most difficult to decipher. Cryptanalysis machines are vital in cracking messages we do not yet know the code for and will be a valuable asset to our deciphering team.§!
upgrade_crypto_strength코0=Reinforced Encryption
upgrade_crypto_strength_desc코0=§WSensitive information is vulnerable to external hackers when it is transferred between different departments or individuals. We must ensure that all internal communication is sufficiently encrypted so as to keep it safe from prying eyes.
upgrade_crypto_strength_2코0=Machine Learning
upgrade_crypto_strength_2_desc코0=§WAdvancements in artificial intelligence have made the integration of machine learning into cybersecurity systems possible. This will allow our systems to learn from past attacks, prevent future reoccurrences and respond dynamically when attacks occur.§!
