Lacks_International_Recognition_Taiwan코0=Lacks International Recognition
Lacks_International_Recognition_Taiwan_desc코0=The ability of the Republic of China to conduct foreign policy is severely limited by its lack of international recognition, given that most states have chosen to recognize the People's Republic of China, its rival to the title of legitimate representative of the Chinese people. The ROC has sought to retain the loyalty of the few states that continue to recognize it, but it is fighting a losing battle. Two other paths lie before this country that is not a country - eventually reunify with the Chinese mainland, or go it alone and seek to be recognized not as the Republic of China, but as an independent Republic of Taiwan.

South_China_Sea_Dispute_desc코0=China's claims in the South China Sea overlap with those of many Southeast Asian nations. This overlap has led to substantial friction between China and countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent Malaysia. The stakes in this dispute are high due to the strategic location of islands like the Spratly and Paracel islands and the presence of oil in the region. The South China Sea issue has significantly hampered the improvement of relations between China and its rivals for control over the sea's many islands.
Sino_Indian_Tensions코0=Sino-Indian Tensions
Sino_Indian_Tensions_desc코0=As Asia's two most up and coming economic and military powers, India and China make for natural rivals.

America_in_Decline_desc코0=Once the undisputed global hegemon, America's influence abroad now pales in comparison to that of the new superpower, China. The US must either come to terms with this new world order and retreat into itself, or challenge China's newfound supremacy and maintain the US-centric world order. The latter can be brought about either by force or by supporting less revisionist political forces in China.

Russia_on_the_Wane_desc코0=Russia knows all too well what it is like to lose great power status. In the years following the end of the Cold War the new Russian Federation has sought to recover some of its former glory. Until recently Russia was aided in this goal by China, with the strategic partnership of both countries helping to undermine American hegemony. However China's great power aspirations have undermined Russia's position, as the Slavic giant has been forced out of its Central Asian sphere of influence by Chinese money. Russia must now either accept being a secondary power or seek to halt China's seemingly inexorable rise either by force or by supporting less revisionist political forces in China.

#Hong Kong
Basic_Law코0=The Basic Law
Basic_Law_desc코0=The Basic Law was the founding document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. Among other things, the document outlines the status of Hong Kong relative to China, granted it autonomy in all matters other than defence and foreign affairs, both of which are entrusted to the central government.
One_Country_Two_Systems코0=One Country Two Systems
One_Country_Two_Systems_desc코0=Hong Kong has been guaranteed 50 years of autonomy from direct Chinese rule. The model of one country two systems allows for a preservation and indeed growth of many of Hong Kong's treasured political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of public assembly. The absence of these rights in the mainland is a significant driver behind support for the \"pan-democrat\" camp in Hong Kong politics, with many concerned Hongkongers remaining wary of greater integration with mainland China.
Triads코0=Triads
Triads_desc코0=When the communists took power in China huge numbers of triad members fled to the British territory of Hong Kong for safety. In the following decades powerful triads such as the Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On and 14K triads have run protection rackets, gambling dens and other illicit activities. Despite their anti-communist roots, the triads have also started supporting Chinese interests in Hong Kong due to business connections on the mainland.
Localist_Movement코0=Localist Movement
Localist_Movement_desc코0=Ever since the handover in 1997, tensions between mainland Chinese and Hongkongers have led to the development of localist \"Hong Kong First\" sentiment amongst some local Hongkongers. This sentiment views communist China's political system with distrust, but also views Hong Kong people as culturally distinct and indeed superior compared to the people of China. The rise of this movement from the 2014 Umbrella Movement onward has changed the previously more measured tone of the Hong Kong political divide into one that is more emotive and radical.
Lacks_Universal_Suffrage코0=Lacks Universal Suffrage
Lacks_Universal_Suffrage_desc코0=While the Basic Law calls for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council to eventually be elected by universal suffrage, this eventuality has yet to come to pass primarily due to China's concerns about what may happen if the significantly more popular pan-democrats take control of the government.
Limited_Universal_Suffrage코0=Limited Universal Suffrage
Limited_Universal_Suffrage_desc코0=China has agreed to allow the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be elected by universal suffrage, on the condition that candidates must be vetted by China first. This is widely seen as a move to reduce the likelihood of pan-democrat or localist candidates becoming Chief Executive.
Universal_Suffrage코0=Universal Suffrage
Universal_Suffrage_desc코0=China has finally agreed to permit Hong Kong to elect its Chief Executive by way of universal suffrage without interference by the Chinese authorities.

#Korea
KOR_joint_us_exercises코0=Foal Eagle
KOR_joint_us_exercises_desc코0=Foal Eagle is an annual training exercise conducted annually by the armed forces of the Republic of Korea and the United States. These exercises are viewed by both nations as necessary defensive preparations in case of a North Korean invasions, but the North views them as a prelude to aggressive US-ROK action.
NKO_nuclear_tests코0=Nuclear Tests
NKO_nuclear_tests_desc코0=Every few years the DPRK conducts nuclear weapons tests. This has drawn widespread condemnation by outside powers, including China despite its close relationship with North Korea. While North Korea maintains that its nuclear weapons program is defensive in nature, many fear the possibility that [NKO.GetLeader] could use the weapons on America or its allies.

#International Recognition
Non_State_Actor코0=Non-State Actor
Non_State_Actor_desc코0=Many international actors, from rebel groups to NGOs, possess international significance but are severly disadvantaged in a number of different ways by virtue of not being recognized states. Some of these non-state actors aspire to take control of an existing state by overthrowing an unjust government or to fashion a new one and redraw international borders. Others have no ambition for statehood, but instead use blunt force to accumulate power and wealth in local environments where the authority of the central government is absent.
Lacks_International_Recognition코0=Aspiring State
Lacks_International_Recognition_desc코0=Some states possess everything you would normally associate with a state. A bureaucracy, a military, a national flag and so on. However, their statehood will never be complete without the added benefits conferred by the stamp of legitimacy of international recognition. These states may seek to acquire this recognition by campaigning for their cause overseas, with the eventual aim of winning the support of a critical mass of states in order to become full members of the international community.
rival_government코0=Rival Government
rival_government_desc코0=Civil wars over control of the entire nation tend to produce two or more governments that claim to be the legitimate representatives of their people. This government is one that makes such a claim, but is disadvantaged by the fact that its status as legitimate representative is only recognized by a few other states, if any. It therefore does not represent its nation at international forums like the United Nations.

#Myanmar/Burma

ASEAN_Member코0=ASEAN Member
ASEAN_Member_desc코0=ASEAN is a primarily economic intergovernmental organisation based in Jakarta that was originally established in 1967. It has since expanded to include those countries that were originally excluded in the tense environment of the Cold War, and has sought to counter the growing influence of China as well as maintain independence from the West. It is committed to the principles of multilateralism, international law, peaceful dispute settlement, non-interference and self-determination.
Rohingya_Crisis코0=Rohingya Crisis
Rohingya_Crisis_desc코0=Rakhine state has seen occasional outbursts of violence between Muslims describing themselves as “Rohingya” and local Rakhine Buddhists as well as the tatmadaw. The often brutal treatment of the Rohingya by the state of Myanmar has drawn strong condemnation from human rights organisations and Western countries, while Buddhist Nationalists in Rakhine state and elsewhere in Myanmar see the violence as a justified measure against illegal Bengali immigrants.
Ethnic_Insurgencies코0=Ethnic Insurgencies
Ethnic_Insurgencies_desc코0=Since independence Myanmar has been engulfed by ethnic insurgencies in its remote, isolated border regions. Ethnic groups including the Karen, Kachin, Shan and many others see the central government as overwhelmingly Burman and Buddhist and so have taken up arms to preserve their unique ways of life.
Democracy_Movement코0=Democracy Movement
Democracy_Movement_desc코0=Since the protests of 1988 the popular will for liberalisation in Myanmar has been strong. This support for democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi increasingly weakens the Tatmadaw’s once firm grip on power.
Western_Sanctions코0=Western Sanctions
Western_Sanctions_desc코0=This state’s flagrant disregard for human rights and the threat it poses to international peace and security have led to harsh American and EU sanctions including a ban on imports, asset freezes, and visa restrictions on officials.
A_Political_Military코0=A Political Military
A_Political_Military_desc코0=Ever since the 1962 Burmese coup the Tatmadaw has been the dominant force in the politics of Myanmar. A disdain for civilian rule, democracy and freedom of speech on the one hand and a unified military culture shaped by decades of intense counterinsurgency warfare on the other have combined to produce a cohesive and politically active military. Signs that this is beginning to change have only recently begun to emerge.

Struggle_for_power_desc코0=The civilian and military arms of the government are currently embroiled in an intense struggle for dominance, a struggle that is gradually weakening the nation.
Anti_tatmadaw_sentiment코0=Anti-Tatmadaw Sentiment
Anti_tatmadaw_sentiment_desc코0=When the tatmadaw chose to retain control over Myanmar rather than pass the torch to the NLD, the already significant hostility to military rule grew rapidly reaching never-before-seen levels.
State_led_economy코0=State-Led Economy
State_led_economy_desc코0=While most of the world views liberal democracy and free-market capitalism as the necessary condition for economic development, the successful examples of South Korea, Taiwan and others points to the need for a strong, militaristic government to provide the foundations for growth.
Buddhism_Official코0=State Religion: Buddhism
Buddhism_Official_desc코0=Having a state religion may appeal to some of the most devout Buddhists, but there is a reason for Burma going through most of its history without one. Having Buddhism as a state religion antagonizes those who subscribe to Christianity, Islam or one of Burma's many other religions. Having a state religion severely exacerbates tensions between the central government and the various often non-Buddhist ethnic rebel groups.
ASEAN_Defence_Treaty코0=ASEAN Mutual Defence Treaty
ASEAN_Defence_Treaty_desc코0=Proposed by Myanmar, this treaty compels ASEAN members to come to each other’s aid in the event of external aggression. It is widely seen as an attempt to deter Chinese aggression.

Chinese_Involvement코0=Chinese Support
Chinese_Involvement_desc코0=Despite being nominally supportive of Myanmar’s central government, China maintains a pragmatic attitude towards the conflict between government and rebels, maintaining close links to those rebel groups that control those regions of Myanmar that border Chinese territory. These links allow rebel groups to benefit from Chinese material assistance.
Low_Chinese_Involvement코0=Low-Level Chinese Support
Low_Chinese_Involvement_desc코0=While only the United Wa State Army receives significant amounts of material assistance from the Chinese central government, many other rebel groups benefit from Chinese involvement in Myanmar more indirectly. These groups buy arms from other groups that get weapons from China, and enjoy close connections to Chinese businessmen and provincial officials who often visit rebel headquarters and attend their events.
Disrupted_Chinese_Involvement코0=Disrupted Chinese Support
Disrupted_Chinese_Involvement_desc코0=The efforts of the central  government’s “secret war” have reduced the ability of the Chinese to provide support to rebel groups. Nonetheless, the assistance continues.
Strategic_Capital코0=Strategic Capital
Strategic_Capital_desc코0=Yangon was deemed too vulnerable a capital for a security-conscious state like Myanmar to have. The relocation of the capital to Naypyidaw means that in the event of an invasion by a powerful external enemy, the Tatmadaw can continue to direct a people's resistance from a more secure location.
Nationwide_Ceasefire_Agreement코0=Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
Nationwide_Ceasefire_Agreement_desc코0=The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement is the result of an unprecedented attempt to initiate real moves towards resolving the internal conflict in Myanmar.

WAA_Narcotics_Producer_desc코0=Wa State has been for many decades a producer of narcotics, whether it be heroin produced through cultivation of the opium poppy or \"ya ba\" methamphetamine tablets.

JAP_deflation_desc코0=§YInterest rate on debt:§! §G-9%§!\n\nFollowing the 1987 Tokyo Stock Market Crash and the burst of the 1992 Asset Price Bubble, Japan's economy has been in decline. With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight.

swiss_political_system코0=Political System of Switzerland
swiss_political_system_desc코0=Switzerland has a very unique political system and is the only country in the world that can rightfully call itself a 'semi-direct democracy'. Citizens can change the constitution per referendum, can veto laws per referendum, can even pass laws per referendum.\nThis has implications for politicians however: Because the people make the policies either way, the Swiss coalition system has to include as many forces as possible. The four big parties of Switzerland, SVP, FDP, CVP and SP, are constantly in government together - this makes national elections in Switzerland more or less useless - as the people rule not through their representatives, but through referendums.

This treaty makes it illegal for Germany to ever make territorial claims, possess nuclear weapons and limits it's armed forces to less than 370.000 personnel in total.

When Austria was founded from the former western allied and Soviet occupation zones in 1955, Austria made a promise to both sides to neither join the western or the eastern alliance, was however soon locked on the western side of the Iron Curtain.\n\nAustria's commitment to a full neutrality has however been questioned when Austria applied to join the EU in 1989 and eventually did in 1995. Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors.
belgian_political_system코0=Political System of Belgium
belgian_political_system_desc코0=Belgium's political system is legendary for being overly complicated. The federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy of Belgium has a king as well as a central and national Belgian parliament (Brussels), a parliament for the Dutch-speaking Flemish community (Brussels), a parliament for the French-speaking Walloon community (Brussels), a parliament for the German-speaking community in the borderlands with Germany (Eupen), as well as a special designation for the officially bilingual capital city Brussels, the 'Capital Region', making Brussels the seat of three parliaments, but putting it ever so slightly out of the jurisdiction of the two regional ones and, of course, under the jurisdiction of its own Brussels parliament.\nAdd to that the subdivision into 10 provinces (not in Brussels though), 43 arrodissements and 589 municipalities and you have a thoroughly complicated and overly inefficient political system - that however succeeds in representing every single citizen sufficiently and thoroughly. Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe.
