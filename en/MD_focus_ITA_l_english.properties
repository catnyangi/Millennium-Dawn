ITA_reintroduce_baby_pensions_desc코0=So-called 'baby pensions" may seem economically absurd.

ITA_recalculate_baby_pensions코0=Recalculate Baby Pensions
ITA_recalculate_baby_pensions_desc코0=Our pension system has been recently changed to increase its sustainability, but a vast number of retirees took advantage of the insane old system that allowed people to retire in their mid thirties with as little as 14 years 6 months and 1 day of work (the infamous baby pensions).

ITA_legalize_light_drugs코0=Legalize It
ITA_legalize_light_drugs_desc코0=Light drugs consumption, mainly cannabis, has proven to be a very minor health concern and our attempts to limit its consumption have failed miserably anyway, resulting only in a costly waste of time for law enforcement and an insane clogging-up of our courts. It's time for us to acknowledge these facts and legalize it.
ITA_reform_the_judiciary코0=Reform the Judiciary
ITA_reform_the_judiciary_desc코0=Our judiciary system is one of the slowest in the developed world. This is a great disservice to our people and a negative factor for business. We must simplify our code to speed up the system.

ITA_modify_article_18코0=Modify Article 18
ITA_modify_article_18_desc코0=Article 18 of the Statute of Workers makes it extremely hard for employers to fire their employees and our jobs market has suffered accordingly.

ITA_modify_article_18_2코0=Modify Article 18
ITA_modify_article_18_2_desc코0=Article 18 of the Statute of Workers makes it extremely hard for employers to fire their employees and our jobs market has suffered accordingly.

ITA_let_companies_fail_desc코0=Every time a company with meaningful weight is on the brink of bankruptcy the Italian state or its local administrations prevent the closure to protect jobs.

ITA_safeguard_european_development_funds_desc코0=Similar to what happened with most of the money drawn from Northern Italy, European funds tend to end up in the wrong hands or simply are left unclaimed.

ITA_let_salaries_decrease코0=Let Salaries Decrease
ITA_let_salaries_decrease_desc코0=The appropriate wage for each major category of jobs is regulated by contracts stipulated by labour unions that have nationwide value.

By renegotiating contracts at a regional level we can significantly reduce the gap between wages and productivity and encourage investment.
ITA_fire_excessive_government_employees코0=Fire Unnecessary Government Employees
ITA_fire_excessive_government_employees_desc코0=It's a common saying that Sicily alone has more forest police than the whole state of Canada. This and other similar examples of bloated administrations have to stop.

ITA_hire_more_government_employees코0=Hire More Government Employees
ITA_hire_more_government_employees_desc코0=Jobs in the government are highly coveted because of their contractual safety, by increasing their amount we'll shrink the number of those that are easily recruited by criminality.

ITA_intensify_money_transfer코0=Intensify Money Transfers
ITA_intensify_money_transfer_desc코0=Infrastructure in the South is quite underdeveloped, improving it will surely unlock the productive potential of the region and repay the North's taxes. Let's just hope that the money does not end up in the wrong hands.

ITA_deafness_in_the_south_desc코0=One of the most important sources of revenue for the Mafia in the south is the "Pizzo", a sum of money that every business, no matter how small, has to pay to the local Family for "Protection".

ITA_war_with_mafia코0=War with Mafia
ITA_war_with_mafia_desc코0=We have done a decent work up till now with our police forces, but the task at hand requires an even stronger approach, it's time to deploy the Italian Army in the streets and make every mafia thug think twice before asking for "pizzo" again.
ITA_relax_legal_framework코0=Relax Legal Framework
ITA_relax_legal_framework_desc코0=Fighting criminal organizations as entrenched in society as the Mafia is not an easy task, doing so with our hands often tied up by our own laws is even worse. We must set up extraordinary measures to adequately confront Mafia.

ITA_turn_the_population_against_them_desc코0=The main strength of Mafia lies in the passive acceptance of society, "Omertà".

ITA_seek_support_of_the_church코0=Seek Church Support

ITA_north_infrastructure코0=Northern Infrastructure Buildup
ITA_north_infrastructure_desc코0=Northern Italy may have the best infrastructure in the country, but there is always room for improvement. New highways and new connections to the mass transit networks of our neighbors will improve the efficiency of the north.

ITA_use_force코0=Stop Immigration
ITA_use_force_desc코0=Unchecked immigration is a vicious cycle: the middle class flees poor countries, becoming the lower class in the richer countries and threatening the existence of the local lower classes. This means that their countries of origin will suffer once they are gone, causing more people to leave for the richer countries, increasing the effect. We need to fight this cycle.
ITA_encourage_immigration코0=Encourage Immigration

italy_md.15.t코0=Earthquake in Amatrice!
italy_md.15.d코0=Today, Italy was hit by earthquake. The epicenter is located in Amatrice, in Lazio, a central Italian region. The earthquake measured 6.2 on the Richter Scale. As of now, 299 people have been reported killed in the areas of Umbria, Lazio and Marche, but at least 238 have been pulled alive from the rubble, with 4,400 people involved in the search and rescue operations.
italy_md.15.o1코0=We will reconstruct everything!
italy_md.16.t코0=Earthquake in L'Aquila!
italy_md.16.d코0=Today, Italy was hit by earthquake. The epicenter is located in L'Aquila, in Abruzzo, a central italian region. The earthquake measured 6.3 on the Richter Scale. As of now, 309 people have been reported killed. This was the deadliest earthquake since the 1980 Irpinia Earthquake, and due to the terrain the city lays on, this may be just the first of a long series of new earthquakes in the region.
italy_md.16.o1코0=Quick and efficient reconstructions!
italy_md.17.t코0=Illegal Immigration Crisis
italy_md.17.d코0=There has been an increase in illegal immigration from Northern Africa in the last years. While it offers us a larger workforce and therefore population in our country, which is suffering from a stagnant birth rate, it also worries a part of our population that thinks that we shouldn't save them from the seas but instead send them back to their country of origin.
italy_md.17.o1코0=We will choose our policy wisely.
italy_md.18.t코0=Stop Mass Migration
italy_md.18.d코0=It's our duty to preserve our superior culture over that of the Africans, and therefore we must protect our borders from the savages. Let's finally put an end to this illegal immigration from the wastelands of Africa.
italy_md.18.o1코0=It's time.
italy_md.19.t코0=Italeave!
italy_md.19.d코0=Our country is better off without European involvement! We must hold a referendum and show everyone that the people of Italy wants to quit this failed and obsolete union. It's finally time to make Italy great again!
italy_md.19.o1코0=Let's hold the referendum today!
italy_md.20.t코0=Italeave Result: Leave!
italy_md.20.d코0=Our people wisely voted for Italy to quit the European Union! We should start negotiations and trigger Article 50 as soon as possible
italy_md.20.o1코0=Wonderful!
italy_md.21.t코0=Italeave Result: Remain!
italy_md.21.d코0=The Italian people have decided to vote against the exit from the European Union, they must be brainwashed by European propaganda! Now we need to decide whetever to trigger Article 50 or not, even if the situation in our country could get a little hot...
italy_md.21.o1코0=We will make our decision.
italy_md.22.t코0=Reform Expectance
italy_md.22.d코0=To represent Italian political instability, one of the main features of the new content given to Italy is the "Reform Expectance" dynamic modifier. Parties in the ruling coalition will see their popularity rapidly deteriorate unless reforms are made. If a coalition member sees its popularity drop below half of the value it was elected with it will leave the coalition. If the coalition loses too much popularity a government crisis will be triggered that can be resolved with new elections or by trying to keep the government alive at the expense of stability.

italy_md.23.t코0=Italian mechanics
italy_md.23.d코0=Some new mechanics have been added to Italy, in this short tutorial you can read more detailed descriptions of their functioning. \n \n This is a fully playable but yet incomplete version of the Italian Rework, you can expect more detailed political mechanics, branches for all missing non-islamist parties, extra flavour and a Military Tree rework in the upcoming updates.

italy_md.24.t코0=The Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria Motorway
italy_md.24.d코0=After more than 50 years of works, the Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria Motorway has opened! The motorway underwent heavy modernisation, and in many cases a completely new parallel motorway was built alongside the original one and involved in most cases a complete rebuilding or replacement of the road where the alignment was retained. Now that the motorway is finally opened, going to and coming from Calabria is going to be way easier, considering that half a century ago it was considered the 'Third Island of Italy' due to the nature of the terrain.
italy_md.24.o1코0=It was about time!
italy_md.25.t코0=Italian Space Decisions
italy_md.25.d코0=By completing the "Increase ASI Funding" in the "Great Projects" branch of the Industrial focus tree you'll unlock access to a set of space-related decisions. A recurring decisions allows you to dedicate more resources to Scientific Space Exploration, which will cost a significant amount of money but will provide research speed increase and a small boost to political power. Most importantly, growing your space program will eventually unlock the capability to setup an Outpost on the Moon which, in turn, will serve as a base for asteroid mining. Asteroid mining allows you to take advantage of strategic raw resources as long as you'll be willing to sustain the pretty significant yearly financial cost required to sustain such endeavour. At the same time you will need to keep your population sufficiently satisfied by the achievment of your space program, otherwise the great expenses and efforts it requires won't be justified any longer and further operations might have to be aborted.

italy_md.27.d코0=A Italian Trade Delegation has arrived in our capital. This will only increase our economic ties to Italy.
italy_md.27.o1코0=That can't be bad, right?
italy_md.28.t코0=Criminals sabotage our industries!
italy_md.28.d코0=Earlier today we received news that our industries and infrastructures were sabotages by heavily equipped criminals. The industries were set on fire and huge explosions happened on highways. Our secret agencies discovered that the attacks are an answer from the feared leaders of the 'Mafia' who didn't take our recent actions against them lightly.
italy_md.28.o1코0=We need to step back
italy_md.28.o2코0=More reasons to erase them from the face of the Earth!
italy_md.29.t코0=Criminals sabotage our military industries!
italy_md.29.d코0=Once again, an attack on our industries took place, as well as bomb attacks on buses and trains. Besides the damanged industries, an unestimated number of people died in the terror attacks in city centres. Once again, all these attacks are connected with organized criminality. When will this ever stop?
italy_md.29.o1코0=We really need to step back
italy_md.29.o2코0=This won't stop us!
italy_md.30.t코0=Mafia
italy_md.30.d코0=Organized criminality is a significant problem in Italy. In the game this is represented with the new Mafia mechanics. All 4 southern states have a major "Clan" associated to them: Cosa Nostra in Sicily, Camorra in Campania, Ndrangheta in Calabria and Sacra Corona Unita in Puglia. Each clan has a strength value that directly reduces growth in the region in which they operate by reducing construction speed and increasing costs and time of foreign investments. Furthermore an average value of all strengths is used to calculate how much Mafia affects the country as a whole through the Mafia national spirit and by increasing focus tree expenditures cost. Industrial focuses now not only have a higher cost based on the current value of mafia influence, but will also increase mafia strength according to how much money criminals are able to siphon off the projects. To fight criminals Italy must employ its police forces and ensure italians collaborate in the eradication of Mafia. Mafia strength increases passively over time, but this increase can be lowered, and even reversed, by taking some national focuses. Furthermore effectivness of decisions to fight mafia will be based on the Police Effectivness value. That value is influenced by some focuses, Corruption, Police funding, regional Mafia strength and the amount of undercover agents in the region. Once average mafia strength has been negligible for some years a victory over Mafia can be finally declared.

italy_md.30.o2코0=Enough explanations.
italy_md.31.t코0=Weekly Stability
italy_md.31.d코0=Many focuses and mechanics in this rework are based on weekly stability. Since vanilla HOI4 has a hard cap on how much that modifier can influence stability, a national spirit has been introduced to ensure the values are applied correctly indefinitely. Most of the choices in the tree will be between an option that grants big immediate benefits in term of stability, with an over time decrease, and an option that will instead lower your stability immediately but increase it gradually over time.

italy_md.32.t코0=The end of organized criminality!
italy_md.32.d코0=For decades their shady businesses were allowed to take place, but never again will something like this happen! Our reforms to target organized criminality in every possible way turned out to be the most successful reforms ever! Italy is now Mafia-free, no longer will our population, especially in southern Italy, suffer because of them.
italy_md.32.o1코0=This is a historic day for Italy!
italy_md.33.t코0=Italy Proposes a Renewal of the Lateran Treaties
italy_md.33.d코0=Once again the new Italian regime seeks to take advantage of the church's vast influence over Italians. In exchange of our support they'll guarantee our safety and independence, what should we respond?
italy_md.33.o1코0=Accept.
italy_md.33.o2코0=Refuse.
italy_md.34.t코0=Italy asks for investments
italy_md.34.d코0=Italy is asking us to invest in their country to help fight economic stagnation.
italy_md.34.o1코0=Accept.
italy_md.34.o2코0=Refuse.
italy_md.35.t코0=Investments Granted
italy_md.35.d코0=Our requests for development aid have been granted.
italy_md.35.o1코0=A great deal.
italy_md.36.t코0=Investments Denied

italy_md.38.t코0=Government Crisis
italy_md.38.d코0=Italians have lost faith in this government's ability to implement the reforms they feel are necessary. The opposition is asking for new elections, but with some political compromises we can keep our seats for some extra time, what should we do?
italy_md.38.o1코0=New Elections
italy_md.38.o2코0=Try to reach the legal end of the legislature.
italy_md.39.t코0=Policy Changes
italy_md.39.d코0=The main mechanic of the new ideology branch is policy change. There are 10 democratic and 6 undemocratic possible choices in the ideology tree, but internal issues, such as reform expectance, or external pressure, such as being influenced, might cause the country to change its course after having already made a choice. In this eventuality the policy change mechanic will unlock the possibility of making a new change in the political direction of the country, removing all the policies of the previous government and unlocking all previous unselected choices. Campaigning to give large advantage to a party (choosing the path of that party), will increase the Reform Expectance of the population, so remember to enact the policies promised, or the government might fall sooner than you expect.

italy_news.1.t코0=Italy turns to Fascism Again
italy_news.1.d코0=Today, the Italian fascist rebels entered parliament by force. With popular support, the republic was dissolved and a new fascist government replaced it. What will happen in Italy now? Will the new fascist government follow Mussolini's old dream by trying to acquire the 'Terre Irredente' by force, or will there be a possible diplomatic approach?
italy_news.1.o1코0=The future is bright for Italy.
italy_news.1.o2코0=A fascist country within the European Union? This is unacceptable!
italy_news.1.o3코0=Only time will tell...
italy_news.2.t코0=Kingdom of Italy Restored!
italy_news.2.d코0=Today, the monarchist supporters staged a coup in Rome, Italy, and the pretender King of the Savoy dinasty, Vittorio Emanuele IV, was called upon to become the new King of Italy. He immediately answered and accepted, and will now rule as an absolute monarch, the first since the end of World War II, when the Italian people voted to turn Italy into a republic.
italy_news.2.o1코0=Long live the King!
italy_news.2.o2코0=What an Interesting Development.
italy_news.3.t코0=The Roman Empire is back!
italy_news.3.d코0=It sounds like a writing prompt, but it is reality. Earlier today, fascist supporters in Italy broke into parliament and declared that the republic was over and that it was going to be replaced by a new fascist government. The new Italian government claims to be the Roman Empire, and aims to recover the lands of the old Empire. Will this happen through diplomacy or war? Only time will tell...
italy_news.3.o1코0=Veni, Vidi, Vici
