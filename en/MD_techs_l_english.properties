Kevlar was first introduced in 1975, and the first vests were adopted to the US Army in the 1980s.\n\nThe first vests offered protection only to the upper torso, and they only protected from shrapnel and pistol rounds.
body_armor_2000코0=Plate Reinforced Vest
body_armor_2000_desc코0=Even though ceramics have been used in personal protection for long, the first modern ballistic plates were introduced in late 90s and early 2000s. The ballistic plates in these new vests would provide protection from rifle rounds, and shrapnel protection of the vest itself would extend to groinal and neck areas and not just the upper torso.
body_armor_2010코0=Improved Tactical Vest
body_armor_2010_desc코0=While offering great protection, plate reinforced vests can be cumbersome to the user. This lead to several body armour manufacturers to look for more lighter and tactical designs. While also providing protection, body armour shouldn't limit a soldiers ability to operate on the field.

modern_blitzkrieg코0=Modern Blitzkrieg
modern_blitzkrieg_desc코0=Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's blitzkrieg doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points.
forward_defense코0=Forward Defense
forward_defense_desc코0=Forward defense was an attempt to counter the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe. Pre-planned defensive forces would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed close to the front.
encourage_nco_iniative코0=Encourage NCO Initiative
encourage_nco_iniative_desc코0=Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed.
air_land_battle코0=AirLand Battle
air_land_battle_desc코0=AirLand battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense and air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear.
grand_battleplan코0=Grand Battleplan
grand_battleplan_desc코0=The grand battleplan doctrine favors extensive pre-planning of each stage of combat. When done correctly, troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it reduces initiative and has no real flexibility.
rigid_hierarchy코0=Rigid Hierarchy
rigid_hierarchy_desc코0=With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be manned out of political loyalty instead of competence. Large, live-fire exercises would generally not be held. Furthermore, decision-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats.
praetorian_guard코0=Praetorian Guard
praetorian_guard_desc코0=With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would receive the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army.
armoured_mass_assault코0=Mass Armoured Assault
armoured_mass_assault_desc코0=Mass armoured assault stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units.

army_group_operational_freedom코0=Army Group Operational Freedom
army_group_operational_freedom_desc코0=While rigid in tactical disposition, the Soviet doctrine allowed significant operational freedom to army group formations, enabling ground commanders to make quick decisions. This freedom was larger than among NATO forces at the time, but it did not extend down to lower officers and commanders.
massed_artillery코0=Massed Artillery
massed_artillery_desc코0=Using large amounts of both regular artillery and rocket artillery concentrated at the frontline enemy, the hope was to break and disrupt their normal functions. Using artillery in such numbers also reduces the need for air support. The sheer numbers led many to call both the Russian and Soviet armies an "artillery army with tanks".
infiltration_assault코0=Infiltration Assault
infiltration_assault_desc코0=The infiltration assault doctrine uses night-time infiltration behind enemy strong points to allow surprise assaults at normally well-defended positions to succeed by cutting them off from reinforcements.
defence_in_depth코0=Defense in Depth
defence_in_depth_desc코0=Defense in depth, often also called "elastic defense", is all about delaying the advance of the enemy. Supply depots and pre-made fortifications should be placed far from the front, as should the majority of forces. By buying time and causing additional enemy casualties by yielding space, the enemy momentum will wear down from attrition.
armoured_counterpunch코0=Armoured Counterpunch
armoured_counterpunch_desc코0=Building upon defense in depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off deep echelon advances, achieving a decisive victory. However, such concentrations are vulnerable to enemy airpower.
frontline_defence코0=Frontline Defense
frontline_defence_desc코0=Massing the majority of pre-planned defensive forces as close to the border as possible yields us the largest chance of maintaining territory, which is essential if we have a limited area to retreat to.

Tactical_Retreats코0=Tactical Retreats
Tactical_Retreats_desc코0=By retreating at an advantageous time, we can preserve our forces while strengthening other areas. As the enemy can not afford to protect all retaken areas sufficiently, we can always return to most of them later. By denying the enemy any decisive victory, we can wear out their morale.
Covert_Relocation코0=Covert Relocation
Covert_Relocation_desc코0=By having the strategic depth to move around forces and not caring about our own territorial integrity, we can covertly relocate forces to where the enemy is weak, gaining decisive advantages.
Autonomus_Combat_Cells코0=Autonomous Combat Cells
Autonomus_Combat_Cells_desc코0=Decentralizing the command structure so that very small groups can operate independently, while at the same time ensuring that no single person or group can identify several other groups, we disrupt the enemy's intelligence gathering efforts.

Networked_Battlefield코0=Networked Battlefield
Networked_Battlefield_desc코0=As software continues to move into an ever more critical role on the battlefield, we must ensure that our forces are never lacking on this growing front. By utilizing the latest in these systems we can ensure our forces function like one organism constantly operating and updating from the movements of others.
Maneuver_Warfare코0=Maneuver Warfare
Maneuver_Warfare_desc코0=The maneuver warfare doctrine sees styles of warfare as a spectrum from attrition warfare to maneuver warfare. In attrition warfare, the enemy is seen as a collection of targets to be found and destroyed. Attrition warfare exploits maneuver to bring to bear firepower. Maneuver warfare exploits firepower and attrition on key elements of opposing forces.
Sensor_Capability_Integration코0=Sensor Capability Integration
Sensor_Capability_Integration_desc코0=Advanced sensor fusion enables units to draw on information from all of their equipped sensors to create a single integrated picture of the battlefield. All of the information gathered is then automatically shared with other units and command and control operating centers on their network using the most modern datalinks.

WOF_Advantages_desc코0=As the quick pace of modern warfare means being surrounded can quickly become the norm, soldiers must take the initiative to seize fleeting moments of temporary advantage. War fighters must learn to operate in small units with minimal support and to force open narrow windows of opportunity with whatever they have at hand.
High_Lethality코0=High Lethality
High_Lethality_desc코0=This doctrine solidifies the effort that in order for our weapons and our military to be most effective not only in actual combat but also as a deterrent, they must be as lethal as possible. Our adversaries and more importantly the men and women that fight for them will know that when our nation executes an attack, death follows.
Centralized_Desicionmaking코0=Centralized Decision-Making

Siege_warfare코0=Siege Warfare
Siege_warfare_desc코0=This strategy is an incorporation of new methods to defeat typical features of modern sieges. As the defender has greater capacity to withstand the siege, the attacker's main aim is to bottle operational forces or create a strategic distraction, rather than take the siege to a conclusion.
Close_combat_lethality코0=Close-Combat Lethality
Close_combat_lethality_desc코0=The close-combat lethality task force will analyze and provide focused recommendations on military service efforts to achieve overmatch to ensure infantry squads are never in a fair fight.

Decapitation_Strike_desc코0=A decapitation strike is a military strategy aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of a hostile group. The strategy of weakening an enemy by eliminating its military or political leadership has long been utilized in warfare, but with the advent of more precision weapons we can apply this strategy on a more tactical scale against our enemies.
Indiscriminate_Force코0=Indiscriminate Force
Indiscriminate_Force_desc코0=When precision and advanced targeting fail us, and when our backs are against the wall, our forces need to be able to use all the resources at their disposal to achieve victory by all means. This means no round, shell, rocket, or missile goes unfired whether the enemy is shielded by noncombatants or not.
Unrestricted_Warfare코0=Unrestricted Warfare
Unrestricted_Warfare_desc코0=Reducing one's opponent can be accomplished in a number of ways other than direct military confrontation.

Eternal_Recurrence코0=Eternal Recurrence
Eternal_Recurrence_desc코0=Through study and as evidenced in the field, COIN operations as they have been instructed to be carried out and how they are actually being conducted are two very different things. We must ensure that our units adhere to the doctrines set forth for COIN operations if we are to make any visible progress as the current path is evidenced to be ineffective.
Tactical_Flexibility코0=Tactical Flexibility
Tactical_Flexibility_desc코0=Though many of the past doctrines have been meant to improve tactical flexibility in one way or another, this doctrine seeks to take a grand look at all of our efforts and correlate them as best as possible to give the ability to change tactics easily and readily to meet new circumstances and conditions.
Battlespace_Dispersion코0=Battlespace Dispersion
Battlespace_Dispersion_desc코0=When the situation arises that meeting our foes directly would mean sure defeat, one strategy we can make use of is a modern version of defeat in detail in which we spread out the battlefield as much as possible while leaving our most mobile units the capacity to quickly resolve the resulting smaller conflicts in our favor.
Economy_of_force코0=Economy of Force
Economy_of_force_desc코0=No part of a force should ever be left without purpose. The allocation of available combat power to tasks like limited attacks, defense, delays, deception or even retrograde operations is measured in order to achieve mass at decisive points elsewhere on the battlefield.
Strategic_Defense코0=Strategic Defense
Strategic_Defense_desc코0=Strategic Defense requires that a defender deploys its resources at and well behind the front line. Although attackers may find it easier to breach the more weakly defended front line, as they advance, they continue to meet resistance. As they penetrate deeper, their flanks become vulnerable.

They have extended range and are larger in size compared to the Corvette class of ship. Though most often used as a platform for fleet defense, they can perform a fairly extensive range of roles within a fleet, and can be customized to meet the demands of many different roles and situations (including more offensive minded tasks). They are typically used for: fleet defense, anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, and maritime convoy duties.
NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_DESTROYERS코0=MISSILE DESTROYERS
NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_DESTROYERS_DESC코0=Intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group, these fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warships are equally capable of independent operation. Later iterations, carrying a wide and deadly array of guided missiles, cruise missiles, and other weapons, are indeed multi-mission war ships. Heavier in tonnage, and more offensive and deadly in firepower, than your Frigate or Corvette. They are typically used for: fleet defense, offensive tasks, anti-aircraft, anti-ship, anti-submarine, as well as land attack duties, dependent upon load out.
NAVAL_TITLE_MISSILE_CRUISERS코0=MISSILE CRUISERS
