western_desc코0=Western and pro-Western governments seek to retain the US-centric Liberal World Order that has reigned supreme since the fall of the Soviet Union.

While the vast majority of countries with a Western Outlook are various forms of democracies, pro-Western strongman governments that benefit from the status quo are also behind them.
emerging_desc코0=Governments with an Emerging Outlook are those, especially in the Global South and Post-Soviet Sphere, that seek to replace the prevailing Liberal World Order with their own alternate institutions and multi-polar way of global politics. They often have differing attitudes towards globalization, forms of government, and domestic policy.

It has grown in prominence as the Wahabi Gulf Monarchies provided billions in funding for its teachings since the mid-20th century. Salafism has seen particularly violent incarnations in the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS.
non_aligned_desc코0=Non-Aligned governments vary vastly in government types and sub-ideologies, and usually have a very pragmatic approach to their foreign alignments.

nationalism_desc코0=Nationalistic governments believe they have gotten the short stick of globalization, and seek a national rebirth based on protectionism, militarization, and national and ethnic sovereignty. They loathe global liberal institutions, but may remain pragmatic in their international alignments to further their domestic or expansionist goals.

SAU.Vilayat_e_Faqih_icon코0=£SAU_hardline_shite
SAU.Vilayat_e_Faqih_desc코0=Shia Islamist - Hezbollah al-Hejaz is an underground group that has waged a low-level armed struggle against the Saudi government since the 1980s. It seeks to replace the House of Saud with an Islamic Republic, inspired by the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It adheres to Khomeini's ideology of wilayat al-faqih, which concentrates power in the hands of a supreme jurist, and has therefore aligned itself with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Unlike the moderate Reform Movement, it has refused to reconcile with the Saudi monarchy and continues to pursue extremist tactics.
SAU.Mod_Vilayat_e_Faqih코0=£generic_Mod_Vilayat_e_Faqih_small Islahiyyah
SAU.Mod_Vilayat_e_Faqih_desc코0=Shia Islamist (Shirazi) - Islahiyyah, or the Reform Movement, is a loose network of Shia scholars from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia that adheres to the teachings of Mohammad al-Shirazi, a prominent Shia figure who came to oppose Ayatollah Khomeini and his ideology of wilayat al-faqih. While the Reform Movement once waged an underground insurgency against the Saudi government as the Organization for Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula, in the 90s it moderated its rhetoric, broke off ties with Iran and agreed to dissolve itself in order to reach an accord with King Fahd, who agreed to release its members. Today the former members of the movement support moderate reform over Iranian-inspired revolution, a strategy that has allowed the Saudi monarchy to tolerate their continued activity but which has alienated the more radically-minded Shia youth.

SAU.Caliphate_desc코0=Salafi Jihadist - Al-Qaeda is a Salafist jihadist movement founded by Osama bin Laden and other so-called "Afghan Arabs" who fought for the Mujahideen during the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Drawing upon the ideology of Sayyid Qutb, al-Qaeda has come to be the organization most commonly associated with Islamic terror. Its appeal for global jihad has allowed it to gain a presence across the Muslim world. Ever since King Fahd rejected bin Laden's offer of military assistance against Saddam Hussein during the invasion of Kuwait and instead solicited American support, al-Qaeda has sought to overthrow the House of Saud by force.
SAU.Kingdom코0=£SAU_kingdom House of Saud
SAU.Kingdom_icon코0=£SAU_kingdom
SAU.Kingdom_desc코0=Wahhabi Monarchist - Since Abdulaziz "Ibn Saud" conquered the majority of the Arabian Peninsula in the early 1900s, the House of Saud has ruled over the lands of Najd, Hejaz, the Eastern Province, Asir, Jizan and Najran. The al-Sauds have relied on an alliance with the followers of al-Wahhab,a Salafi cleric who advocated a return to a "purer" form of Sunni Islam. The religious legitimacy granted by Wahhabism has supported Saudi rule through the issuing of fatwas by Wahhabi clerics that sanctify Saudi political decisions. The Saudi brand of Salafism, which forbids any form of political opposition and protest, is distinct from more populist brands of Salafism which oppose the concentration of religious authority in a political elite or advocate global jihad.

The movement has pushed for genuine political reform in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but has failed to achieve success due to the Saudi monarchy's imprisonment and co-optation of dissenting clerics.

BRA.Nat_Populism코0=£BRA_Nat_Populism Social Liberal Party
BRA.Nat_Populism_desc코0=The Social Liberal Party (PSL) is a far-right[16] political party in Brazil. Founded in 1994 as a social liberal party, the PSL was registered on the Superior Electoral Court in 1998. In January 2018, former Social Christian Party politician Jair Bolsonaro joined the party and later converted it into an economically liberal, nationalist, radically anti-communist and social conservative party. The original name remained after the ideological shift, and after Livres (the party's original main wing) left the party and formed their own political movement to continue the party's original goals.
BRA.Monarchist코0=£BRA_Monarchist House of Orleans-Braganza
BRA.Monarchist_desc코0=The House of Orléans and Bragança, is a branch of the French Orléans dynasty. It descends, on the male side, from the Casa de Orléans, from France, and, on the female side, from the Brazilian branch of the House of Bragança. The house was founded with the marriage of Isabel of Brazil and Gastão de Orléans, Count of Eu, and was never reigning, as was the House of Bragança with Pedro I and Pedro II. Since the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil in 1889, its descendants have claimed the imperial throne of Brazil.

BRA.PSOL_icon코0=£BRA_PSOL
BRA.PSOL_desc코0=The Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) is a Brazilian political party with 147,096 active members. PSOL is a left-wing to far-left party which is self-described as socialist and democratic. PSOL was formed after Heloísa Helena, Luciana Genro, Babá and João Fontes (also a federal deputy, now a member of the Democratic Labour Party, PDT) were expelled from the Workers' Party after voting against the pension reform proposed by Lula.
BRA.ALIANCA코0=£BRA_ALIANCA Alliance for Brazil
BRA.ALIANCA_icon코0=£BRA_ALIANCA
BRA.ALIANCA_desc코0=Alliance for Brazil (ALIANÇA) is a Brazilian political group that aims to become a political party. With national-conservative roots, it was announced by President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro on 12 November 2019, after stating his departure from the Social Liberal Party (PSL). After a meeting in Palácio do Planalto with PSL lawmakers, Bolsonaro notified them of his resignation from the party and discussed ways to create a new one, but the President still didn't formalize his de-affiliation from PSL at that time.
BRM.Neutral_Libertarian코0=£BRM_Neutral_Libertarian National League for Democracy
BRM.Neutral_Libertarian_desc코0=Libertarian - The National League for Democracy (NLD) is a liberal pro-democracy party that was founded in the wake of the 8888 Uprising in 1988 by Aung San Suu Kyi. The NLD quickly grew to become the biggest threat to military rule.
BRM.neutral_Social코0=£generic_neutral_Social_small People's Party
BRM.neutral_Social_desc코0=Democratic Socialist - The People's Party is a new left-wing political party founded by veteran pro-democracy campaigner Ko Ko Gyi. It is a party that favours greater democratic reforms and the establishment of a federal union to resolve Myanmar's civil war.
BRM.Neutral_Communism코0=£BRM_Neutral_Communism National Unity Party
BRM.Neutral_Communism_desc코0=Communist - The National Unity Party was originally founded as an electoral vehicle of the military government. Since losing terribly to the NLD in the 1990 parliamentary elections however, it has diverged from its roots to become one of the most significant, if not successful, opposition parties.

BRM.Nat_Autocracy코0=£BRM_Nat_Autocracy Tatmadaw
BRM.Nat_Autocracy_desc코0=Militay Junta - Since the 1960s the Tatmadaw has been the most influential political force in Myanmar. Ethnic rebellions, most significantly by the Karen, and an occupation of Burmese territory by Chinese Nationalist troops fleeing the civil war, presented challenges to post-independence Burma that the military used to extend its political importance and eventually take over the government. In recent decades, however, the pro-democracy movement has weakened the Tatmadaw's political position and forced it to consider new options.
BRM.Nat_Populism코0=£BRM_Nat_Populism Union Solidarity and Development Party
BRM.Nat_Populism_desc코0=Right-Wing Populist - The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) was established in 2010 as the pro-military party. While remaining supportive of the Tatmadaw's role in government, the USDP has shown itself to be more open about political change in Myanmar than its predecessors.
BRM.Nat_Fascism코0=£generic_Nat_Fascism_small Arakan National Party
BRM.Nat_Fascism_desc코0=Fascist - The Arakan National Party is the result of a merger between the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party and the Arakan League for Democracy. The party is perhaps the strongest ethnic political party in Myanmar, drawing its support from the Arakan Buddhists in Rakhine states whose interests it protects. However, the party has espoused hardline attitude towards Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State that have led some outside observers to label the party far-right or even fascist.

HKG.Autocracy코0=£HKG_Autocracy The New People's Party (NPP)
HKG.Autocracy_desc코0=Conservative - The New People's Party is widely viewed as an electoral vehicle for the prominent pro-Beijing politician, Regina Ip. Her advocacy of national security legislation and her claims that foreign powers used social media to interfere in protests have made her a controversial figure.

HKG.anarchist_communism_desc코0=Left-Wing Radicalism - The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions has for a long time been closely associated with the CCP in China. The trade union played a major role in the 1967 Leftists riots against the British colonial authorities, and today maintains its pro-Beijing, working class position that sets it apart from both the anti-Beijing pan-democrats and the other, more middle class pro-Beijing parties.
HKG.Neutral_conservatism코0=£generic_Neutral_conservatism_small Path of Democracy
HKG.Neutral_conservatism_desc코0=Centrist - Path of Democracy is a small centrist party that portrays itself as above the binary distinction between the pro-Beijing camp and the pan-democrats.

HKG.Nat_Populism코0=£generic_Nat_Populism_small Localists
HKG.Nat_Populism_desc코0=Nationalist Populism - The localists are a political grouping that encompasses a wide-range of different parties, united by their desire for self-determination in Hong Kong. Groups like Youngspiration, Demosisto and the Hong Kong National Party came to the fore during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and represent a new, more radical and more populist brand of Hong Kong politics, one that is marred by controversy. Some localists advocate for a preservation of Hong Kong's unique culture, others for restrictions on tourism and immigration from the mainland. Some of the more extreme localists advocate independence or even a temporary return to British rule as a transitionary measure. Regardless, they are viewed with admiration by a significant proportion of the youth and disapproval verging on disgust by the older segment of the population.

#Italy
ITA.conservatism코0=£ITA_western_conservative Forza Italia
ITA.conservatism_desc코0=Forza Italia is a right-wing conservative party founded in 1994 by Marcello dell'Utri from the ashes of “Democrazia Cristiana”, at the time decimated by "Mani Pulite", an investigation into a major corruption scandal. The most relevant event for the party is the “descent into the field” of Silvio Berlusconi, known for his real-estate assets and media networks. Berlusconi has become by far the most prominent member and this has resulted in the party's electoral fortunes being directly tied to Berlusconi’s charisma and judiciary vicissitudes. The claimed goal of the party is lowering taxes for both the general population and businesses and guaranteeing stability and rule-of-law for citizens.
ITA.conservatism_icon코0=£ITA_western_conservative
ITA.liberalism코0=£ITA_western_liberal_old Federazione dei Liberali
ITA.liberalism_desc코0=The Federation of Liberals reunites various social liberal parties from the middle ground of Italian politics. Loosely inspired by the ideals of the Italian Liberal Party, founded in 1919 by Giovanni Giolitti. Despite being considered establishment in most of Europe, Social Liberalism has had very limited electoral fortunes in Italy since the death of Luigi Einaudi decades ago, having to deal with very ideologically flexible traditional parties and a population generally more wary of capitalism than the rest of the developed world. They strongly believe in the free market while at the same time advocating for welfare and social rights.

ITA.socialism코0=£ITA_western_social_democrat Partito Democratico
ITA.socialism_desc코0=Born from the merger of a myriad of left-wing parties, such as La Margherita and Democratici di Sinistra the Democratic Party was born with the goal of uniting all the left leaning Italian parties in a single coalition and let the various takes on ideology compete with an internal democratic system. While this has proven to be a good choice vote-wise, with PD becoming the biggest party in Italy, it led to a very divided party that often ends up having its hands tied because of the fear of splits. Generally, it believes in the necessity of a sizeable welfare state, the necessity of moderate government intervention in the economy and social rights.
ITA.Communist-State코0=£ITA_emerging_communism Partito Comunista Italiano
ITA.Communist-State_desc코0=The original PCI “Partito Comunista Italiano” dissolved when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Many smaller entities tried to pick up its legacy afterwards but failed considerably at recreating what was the biggest communist party of the West at its peak. The PCI follows Soviet Leninist and Stalinist thought, with a Classical vision of Soviet communism. Redistributing land and the means of production is a major part of their goals and no way of achieving those goals is off the table. A dictatorial transitional period might be needed to ensure the safety of the proletarian revolution once its time finally arrives. As Berlusconi once said, it is clear that they are and always will be poor Communists. 
ITA.anarchist_communism코0=£ITA_left_wing_radical Movimento 5 Stelle
ITA.anarchist_communism_desc코0=The Movimento 5 Stelle (5-star movement), was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo after years of meetups. Its stars represent the fundamental battles of the movement: Water, Environment, Transport, Connectivity, Development. The movement bases its entire organization on a web platform, the same place where it was born. To qualify for a candidacy the applicants must have a completely clean criminal record, but no other requirements. Their elected members have often embraced conspiracy theories, fake news and non-scientific claims. Although the party is strongly controlled by a private group that owns all its infrastructure, they strongly believe in direct democracy. The Movement embraces a wide spectrum of ideologies and, as many other populist parties, it is renowned for rapidly changing position on many issues. At its core it has a left-leaning ideology influenced by Venezuelan, Cuban and Chinese examples, strongly geared towards opposing the elites and in the rejection of capitalism.
ITA.Conservative코0=£ITA_non_aligned_conservative Lega Nord (Salvini)
ITA.Conservative_desc코0=While the Northern League was born as an independentism movement in the Northern half of Italy, a great deal of success was achieved by the party once it shifted its main focus from the southern question and internal immigration to external immigration. Manipulating anti-immigrant sentiments has ensured the movement an unprecedented support and, together with support from Russia and the American far-right, has allowed the party to promote from regional to national level. As with many other populist parties, it is renowned for rapidly changing position on many issues, but at its core it is a reactionary party, strongly believing in the necessity to reaffirm traditional Christian values. Economically it is mostly in favor of government intervention but at the same time claims that it plans to lower taxes.
ITA.Neutral_conservatism코0=£ITA_non_aligned_conservative Lega Nord (Bossi)
ITA.Neutral_conservatism_desc코0=Lega Nord was born from the union of various Lombard and Venetian independence movements and parties, and then spread to a large part of Northern Italy, tired of the dead weight of Southern Italy and the state bureaucracy that prevents the North from meeting its true potential. The party is mostly concerned about internal migration, decentralization and lowering taxes and bureaucracy.
ITA.neutral_Social코0=£ITA_non_aligned_social Liberi e Uguali
ITA.neutral_Social_desc코0=Free and Equal is a left-wing party founded in 2007 by former anti-mafia magistrate Pietro Grasso after splitting from the Democratic Party, of which it represented most of its left-most wing. It is a socialist progressive party that strongly focuses on social, women and migrant rights and in fighting inequalities through government intervention.
ITA.Neutral_Libertarian코0=£ITA_non_aligned_libertarian Partito Radicale
ITA.Neutral_Libertarian_desc코0=Even if the name suggests otherwise, the Radical Party is not a traditional party as it doesn’t participate in elections. It has instead decided to focus on campaigning for resolving issues through other means. But, at the same time, many dedicated electoral lists have emerged from the Party environment for specific elections. The Radical Party is libertarian, pacifist and progressive and mostly fights against prohibitionism, government intervention and for social rights like abortion and divorce.
ITA.Neutral_Communism코0=£ITA_neutral_communism Partito della Rifondazione Comunista
ITA.Neutral_Communism_desc코0=Communist Refoundation is one of the many parties that emerged from the collapse of the Italian Communist Party in 1991. Unlike the new Italian Communist Party, it is openly anti-Stalinist, anti-fascist and pacifist. It believes that the goals of the communist revolution can and must be achieved through peaceful and democratic means. 
ITA.Neutral_green코0=£ITA_non_aligned_greens Verdi Italiani
ITA.Neutral_green_desc코0=The Federation of Greens is an environmentalist, social democratic and pacifist party, founded in 1986 in response to the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Born with the noble intent of preserving the environment, like many Green parties across the world it has since embraced many anti-scientific and environmentally damaging battles such as those against nuclear energy or waste incinerators, directly fueling “nimby” behaviors. Believing that the only key to preserve the environment is to reverse the paradigm of endless growth, it has embraced a distinct anti-capitalist and anti-globalist view.

Strongly inspired by fascism, the party is openly critical of capitalism and communism, instead striving to re-enact the “third way”.
ITA.Nat_Populism코0=£ITA_nationalist_right_wing_populist Alleanza Nazionale
ITA.Nat_Populism_desc코0=The National Alliance Party was founded in 1995, when the Movimento Sociale Italiano separated into its two sections, Fiamma Tricolore and the Alleanza Nazionale, the latter being the more moderate wing. Its main beliefs are based on the “Destra Sociale” ideology: a right-wing party with a traditionalist and anti-globalist view of society paired with support for the welfare state and government intervention in the economy.
ITA.Monarchist코0=£ITA_nationalist_monarchist Casa Savoia
ITA.Monarchist_desc코0=The House of Savoy is one of the oldest dynasties in Europe, having reigned in the county of Savoy since the last decades of the first millennium. During the Risorgimento period, the Savoyard kingdom unified the peninsula and founded the Italian Nation. Having effectively handed over the country to Mussolini, the monarchy was abolished with a referendum after the second World War and the Savoy family was exiled, but thanks to the removal of the XIII provision from the Constitution, the Savoia family was able to return to Italian soil.
ITA.Western_Autocracy_roman_desc코0=The last century’s fascist narrative has revived the faded memories of ancient Rome and eventually those memories guided Italy into raising the Imperial Eagle once more. The recently arisen New Roman Empire has resized its ambitions, having to consider the powers of the modern world, but still retains the quest to reach its former glory as a major objective. Finding the correct balance between retaining old western alliances and recovering rightful Roman lands will be pivotal for the young Empire. While War is the fastest way to restore old borders, risks that come with it might be too great for the Nation to bear, thus a peaceful expansion is believed to be the best strategy to pursue Roman Restoration.

While nominally not an autocracy, the power is in the hands of the Senate, a relatively small group chosen among the industrial, political and military elites of the country, qualifying it as an Oligarchy. The recently arisen New Roman Republic has resized its ambitions, having to consider the powers of the modern world, but still retains the quest to reach its former glory as a major objective. Finding the correct balance between maintaining western and eastern powers at bay while recovering rightful Roman lands will be pivotal for the young Republic.
